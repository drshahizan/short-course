# Exercise 5: Applying the PRISMA Framework to a Systematic Review in Computer Science

### **Objective**
This exercise aims to help students apply the **PRISMA 2020 framework** to conduct a systematic review on a chosen **Computer Science** research topic. They will practice documenting their search and selection process using the **PRISMA flow diagram**.



### **Step 1: Define Your Research Question**
Before conducting a systematic review, define a clear and structured research question using the **PICO (Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome)** or **SPIDER (Sample, Phenomenon of Interest, Design, Evaluation, Research type)** framework.

#### **Task:**
1. Identify a Computer Science research topic of interest (e.g., AI in cybersecurity, blockchain in healthcare, IoT security, etc.).
2. Formulate your research question using PICO or SPIDER.

**Example:**  
*"How effective are machine learning models in detecting cybersecurity threats compared to traditional rule-based systems?"*



### **Step 2: Conduct a Systematic Search**
Students will conduct a literature search using **academic databases** relevant to Computer Science.

#### **Task:**
1. Identify at least **three academic databases** to search for research papers (e.g., **IEEE Xplore, ACM Digital Library, Springer, ScienceDirect, Google Scholar**).
2. Use Boolean operators (**AND, OR, NOT**) to refine your search queries.
3. Record the total number of studies retrieved from each database.

üìå **Example Search Query for AI in Cybersecurity:**  
*(‚Äúmachine learning‚Äù OR ‚Äúdeep learning‚Äù) AND (‚Äúcybersecurity‚Äù OR ‚Äúthreat detection‚Äù) AND (‚Äúperformance‚Äù OR ‚Äúaccuracy‚Äù)*



### **Step 3: Remove Duplicates**
After retrieving research papers, students should remove duplicate records.

#### **Task:**
1. Use a **reference management tool** (e.g., **Zotero, Mendeley, EndNote**) to detect and delete duplicate records.
2. Record the number of duplicate studies removed.



### **Step 4: Screening Process**
Students will screen the remaining papers based on their **titles and abstracts** to exclude irrelevant studies.

#### **Task:**
1. Read **titles and abstracts** of all retrieved papers.
2. Exclude studies that are **not relevant** based on predefined **inclusion/exclusion criteria**.
3. Record the number of excluded studies.

üìå **Example Exclusion Criteria:**
- Studies older than 10 years.
- Non-English articles.
- Non-peer-reviewed studies (e.g., blog posts, editorials).



### **Step 5: Assess Full-Text Eligibility**
Students will retrieve and review the **full texts** of the remaining studies to determine their eligibility.

#### **Task:**
1. Download and read the **full-text articles** of selected studies.
2. Exclude studies based on deeper criteria (e.g., missing key experimental details).
3. Record the number of excluded studies and provide reasons.

üìå **Example Exclusion Reasons:**
- **Reason 1:** Lacks empirical evaluation.
- **Reason 2:** Focuses on a different field (e.g., AI in finance, not cybersecurity).
- **Reason 3:** Duplicate study from another source.


### **Step 6: PRISMA Flow Diagram Completion**
Using the **PRISMA 2020 flow diagram**, students will document their review process.

#### **Task:**
1. Fill in the **PRISMA flow diagram** with:
   - Number of studies identified.
   - Number of duplicates removed.
   - Number of studies screened, excluded, and included in the final review.
2. Justify the inclusion/exclusion decisions.

üìå **Example PRISMA Data Entry:**
| **Step** | **Number of Studies** |
|----------|--------------------|
| **Records Identified** | 150 |
| **Duplicates Removed** | 20 |
| **Records Screened** | 130 |
| **Records Excluded** | 80 |
| **Full-Text Reports Assessed** | 50 |
| **Full-Text Reports Excluded** | 30 (Reasons given) |
| **Studies Included in Review** | 20 |



### **Step 7: Interpretation and Discussion**
Students should analyze their findings and discuss how the PRISMA framework helped structure their systematic review.

#### **Task:**
1. Summarize the **final number of studies** included.
2. Explain the **importance of PRISMA** in maintaining transparency in research.
3. Discuss **challenges** faced during the systematic review process.



## **Submission Requirements**
1. **Completed PRISMA flow diagram** (filled with real numbers from their search process).
2. **Short report (1‚Äì2 pages)** explaining their systematic review process, including:
   - Research question.
   - Search strategy.
   - Inclusion/exclusion criteria.
   - Summary of final selected studies.



## **Expected Learning Outcomes**
By completing this exercise, students will:
‚úÖ Understand the **PRISMA framework** for systematic reviews.  
‚úÖ Develop skills in **literature searching and screening**.  
‚úÖ Improve their ability to **document and justify research decisions**.  
‚úÖ Gain practical experience in **conducting a systematic review** in **Computer Science**.
