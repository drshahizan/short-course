### üîπ 1. Search and screen for Literature

1. **Formulate a Research Question**:
   - **Using PICO**: The PICO framework helps to structure a research question by focusing on the Population, Intervention, Comparison, and Outcomes.
   - **Clarity and Focus**: The question should be clear and focused, often addressing a specific issue or aspect of the topic.
   - **Answerable**: It should be structured in a way that makes it possible to find an answer through a systematic search and review of the literature.

2. **Develop a Protocol**:
   - **Review's Methodology**: This includes the rationale for the review, hypotheses or objectives, and the criteria for considering studies for the review.
   - **Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria**: Clearly define what types of studies will be included or excluded, based on factors like study design, population, interventions, outcomes, and publication status.
   - **Quality Assurance**: The protocol acts as a plan to guide the review and ensure consistency and transparency in the process.

3. **Search for Literature**:
   - **Comprehensive Search**: Use a combination of keywords and database-specific search terms to conduct a thorough search across multiple databases and sources.
   - **Documenting the Search**: Keep a record of the search strategy, including the databases searched, the date of search, and the number of results obtained.
   - **Managing Results**: Use tools or software to manage the search results, which can include thousands of studies.

4. **Screen the Literature**:
   - **Initial Screening**: Review titles and abstracts to determine if they meet the inclusion criteria. This is often done by more than one reviewer to reduce bias.
   - **Secondary Screening**: Review the full texts of selected studies to ensure they meet all the criteria.
   - **Record Keeping**: Maintain detailed records of the screening process, including reasons for excluding studies.

### üîπ 2. Quality Assessment
1. **Assess Study Quality**:
   - **Validity and Reliability**: Assessing the quality of studies involves evaluating their methodological soundness and the trustworthiness of their findings.
   - **Quality Assessment Tools**: Use standardized tools to grade each study, such as the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool for randomized controlled trials.
   - **Bias Identification**: Identify various types of bias, such as selection, performance, detection, and reporting biases, and assess their impact on the study's results.

2. **Extract Data**:
   - **Data Collection**: Skim the full text of included articles to collect information in a structured format, often using a data extraction table.
   - **Information Selection**: Decide on the types of information to extract from each study, which may include study characteristics, outcomes, methodologies, and results.
   - **Accuracy**: Ensure accuracy by having two or more people extract data from each study, and review the collected data for errors.

3. **Synthesize Data**:
   - **Integration and Analysis**: Combine the data from the selected studies, which may involve statistical techniques like meta-analysis, thematic analysis, or narrative synthesis.
   - **Drawing Conclusions**: Use the synthesized data to draw meaningful conclusions, identify patterns, or explore variations in the evidence.
   - **Reporting Findings**: Present the findings in an organized and transparent manner, often including tables, figures, or narrative summaries.
  
### üîπ 3. Writing and Publishing SLR
1. **Write the Report**:
   - **Documenting the Process**: Clearly describe the methodology, including the search strategy, selection criteria, and methods used for data extraction and synthesis.
   - **Presenting Findings**: Summarize the main results, including the study characteristics and the evidence's strength and limitations‚Å¥.
   - **Discussing Conclusions**: Interpret the findings in the context of the existing literature, discussing the implications for practice, policy, and future research.
   - **Ensuring Transparency**: Provide enough detail to allow readers to assess the validity of the findings and the review's reliability‚Åµ.

2. **Publish and Disseminate**:
   - **Choosing the Right Journal**: Select an appropriate journal that reaches the intended audience and aligns with the review's subject area.
   - **Following Guidelines**: Adhere to reporting guidelines such as PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) for structuring the report.
   - **Engaging Stakeholders**: Share the findings with policymakers, practitioners, and other stakeholders who can use the information to make informed decisions.
   - **Promoting Accessibility**: Consider open-access publication options to ensure the review is accessible to a wider audience.
