# 🎓 **Colloquium IIRG Highlight**

**📅 Date Time:** 2025-12-12 09:10:17

**📍 Location:** Hyflex room

**🎤 Speaker:** Ms Nancy Zhu, Professor Dr. Siti Zaiton Hashim, and Assoc Prof Dr. Murtadha Muhammad


## 📝 **Summary**

This document consolidates insights from a series of lectures and colloquia for postgraduate students, featuring a PhD student (Nancy), retired  Professor Dr. Siti Zaiton Hashim, and other faculty members. The sessions provide comprehensive guidance on navigating the PhD and Master's journey, from managing personal and academic challenges to successfully completing the viva voce (oral examination) and publishing research.

Key themes include the emotional and motivational difficulties of postgraduate studies, with speakers emphasizing the need for self-motivation, resilience, and a strong support system. Practical advice is offered on developing good academic habits, such as keeping a research journal, engaging in group study, and maintaining a persistent relationship with supervisors. The lectures provide a deep dive into the research process, covering the importance of a clear problem statement, conducting a literature review, data collection, and cautious use of AI writing tools.

A significant focus is placed on preparing for the viva voce. Speakers detail the purpose of the viva from an examiner's perspective, what examiners look for, the "golden question" about research contribution, common pitfalls to avoid (like defensiveness and over-explaining), and the viva grading system. Practical preparation strategies, such as mock vivas and practicing a "Three-Minute Thesis," are strongly recommended.

The discussions also address the "Postgraduate Edition 2026" vision, which aims to enrich the student experience beyond technical skills by focusing on the real-world impact of research (output, outcome, impact) and professional development. Students are encouraged to leverage university resources, including the Postgraduate Student Society (PGSS), and to take advantage of international opportunities like the Erasmus program and the Global Outreach Program (GOP). Finally, the critical importance of publishing in high-impact journals is highlighted as a means to validate research, build an academic reputation, and prepare for the viva, with guidance provided on navigating the challenges of Article Processing Charges (APC) through available funding.

## 🔖 **Knowledge Points**

### 1. 🎯 **The Postgraduate Journey: Motivation, Mindset, and Support**

* **Emotional and Motivational Challenges:** The PhD journey is a turbulent, non-linear, and emotionally taxing process. It's normal to feel isolated, overwhelmed, and want to quit. Self-motivation is crucial; students should remember why they started and view the PhD as a manageable "story" to complete.
* **Managing Expectations:** Research plans often change. It's important to manage expectations regarding timelines and outcomes, accept delays, and follow your own pace without rushing.
* **Handling Mistakes:** Do not fear mistakes. Feedback from examiners is an opportunity for improvement, not a failure. Stay calm and view criticism as a chance to enhance your skills and research.
* **Developing Good Academic Habits:** Avoid studying alone; engage with peers. Keep a research journal to track progress and identify problems.
* **Building a Support System:** A strong support system of family, supervisors, friends, and colleagues is essential for navigating challenges. The supervisor relationship can evolve into a long-term collegial friendship.
* **Asking for Help:** Do not be afraid or shy to ask for help, especially from your supervisor, who can provide effective solutions. Persistent, regular communication with supervisors is key to staying motivated and on track.

### 2. 🔬 **The PhD Research Process**

* **Proposal and Problem Statement:** The problem statement is the foundation of the thesis. A weak problem statement is a primary reason for major corrections or failure. It should be clear, concise, and developed through extensive reading, often taking up the first year of a PhD.
* **Literature Review:** This phase can be overwhelming. The key is to create a structured plan to manage reading hundreds of articles and proceed step-by-step.
* **Data Collection:** For social sciences, defining the sample is initially difficult. A pilot study is necessary to ensure validity. For quantitative methods, meaningful feedback is more important than the number of questionnaires. For qualitative methods, insightful ideas are the goal, not simple "yes/no" answers.
* **Writing and AI Tools:** Be cautious with AI writing tools. Over-reliance can lead to plagiarism issues, as tools like Turnitin can detect AI-generated content, potentially causing submissions to fail technical checks at top journals. Writing is a skill that improves with practice.
* **Research Impact:** Understand the difference between **output** (direct products like an algorithm), **outcome** (contribution to knowledge), and **impact** (broader contribution to society). Top-tier research should aim for real-world impact.

### 3. 🎤 **The Viva Voce (Oral Examination)**

* **Purpose of the Viva:** It is a scholarly conversation to confirm the thesis is the student's original work, validate the scientific process, and confirm the research's contribution to knowledge. It is not an interrogation.
* **The "Golden Question":** The most important question is, "What is the contribution of your thesis?" Students must be able to answer this concisely in about three sentences. A long, rambling answer indicates a lack of clarity.
* **Examiner Expectations:** Examiners look for clarity, consistency between the problem statement and results, critical thinking, and an awareness of the research's limitations and scope.
* **Common Pitfalls to Avoid:**

  * **Over-explaining:** Do not provide long, rambling answers. Every line in the thesis should be defensible.
  * **Defensiveness:** Avoid becoming defensive. Answer questions calmly and with reasoned justifications.
  * **Reading from Slides:** Use slides as a guide, not a script.
  * **Dishonesty:** Be honest. It is better to admit you don't know an answer and will look into it than to be dishonest.
* **Viva Grading System:**

  * **A:** No or very minor errors (rare).
  * **B1:** Minor corrections (1 month).
  * **B2:** Major corrections (6 months).
  * **C1:** Resubmission of thesis without another viva.
  * **C2:** Resubmission and a second viva.
* **Preparation Strategies:**

  * **Master Your Thesis:** Know your abstract, problem statement, methodology, and results inside and out.
  * **Practice:** Conduct mock vivas with supervisors and peers. Practice a "Three-Minute Thesis" (3MT) to improve clarity and confidence. Practice in front of a mirror.
  * **Relax:** On the day before the viva, trust your preparation and focus on clear communication rather than last-minute changes.

### 4. 📄 **Research Publication**

* **Importance of Publishing:** Publishing in high-impact journals (e.g., Web of Science, Q1/Q2) is a primary objective. It demonstrates scholarly capability, serves as external validation of the research, and builds a strong reputation with examiners. The process of responding to reviewer comments also prepares students for the viva.
* **Challenges and Funding:** The main challenge is high Article Processing Charges (APC).

  * **Funding Sources:** Look for publisher agreements (e.g., Springer Nature's free APC quota), faculty incentives (partial funding), and collaborations with researchers who have funding.
  * **Consult Supervisor:** Always discuss funding options with your supervisor *before* submitting to an expensive journal.
* **Publication Process:**

  * Write a high-quality article.
  * Read a journal's scope and description *before* writing to ensure a good fit.
  * Attend workshops and training on academic writing.

### 5. 🌍 **Student Opportunities and University Resources**

* **Postgraduate Student Society (PGSS):** The PGSS receives funding to organize activities. Students should engage with the PGSS to propose and participate in workshops, networking events, and other programs. The faculty plans to collaborate more with the PGSS.
* **Creative Learning Activities:** The School of Postgraduate Studies (SPS) provides financial support for student-led activities. Students are encouraged to propose creative ideas for memorable learning experiences outside the classroom (e.g., a workshop in the mountains).
* **International Opportunities:**

  * **Erasmus Program:** Offers fully funded opportunities for research in Europe, covering airfare and a monthly stipend.
  * **Global Outreach Program (GOP):** A faculty-run program providing affordable travel and research opportunities in Asian countries.
* **Guidance for Specific Groups:**

  * **Part-Time Students:** Discipline and a strong "pushing factor" are essential. Create a realistic timeline with your supervisor.
  * **Fast-Track Students:** Must put in extra effort to acquire skills in reading journals and writing articles through self-training and active participation in colloquia.

### 6. ❓ **Q&A Session Insights**

* **Study Timeline and COVID-19:** One student shared her 3.5-year PhD journey, which included an online proposal defense and using lockdown time to read extensively.
* **Language Barriers:** For students struggling with English, it's noted they often understand but are afraid to speak. Supervisors can help by finding a professor who knows the student's native language or by learning some of it themselves.
* **Time Management:** Make a plan and stick to it. Even partial progress is better than none. Remembering your core motivation helps maintain focus and avoid distractions.
* **Transitioning to a New Field:** It is possible to switch fields (e.g., from business to computer science). Communicate with classmates from the new field and take relevant foundational courses to catch up.
