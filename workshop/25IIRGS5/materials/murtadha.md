**Speaker: Assoc. Prof. Dr. Mohd Murtadha Mohamad**

This presentation introduces **Postgraduate Vision 2026**, a strategic roadmap designed to strengthen postgraduate education at UTM in response to **rapid technological advancements**, **growing stakeholder expectations**, and **global competition**. It explains how the landscape of **digital informatics**, **artificial intelligence**, **data analytics**, and **Industry 4.0** creates new opportunities for impactful research while also revealing challenges such as **siloed research**, **limited cross-faculty collaboration**, and the need to balance **academic rigour** with **real-world relevance**.

Postgraduate Vision 2026 focuses on three pillars: **engagement**, **research**, and **collaboration**. Engagement efforts aim to build a supportive academic environment through **colloquia**, **mentoring circles**, and active community-building. Research initiatives promote **interdisciplinary clusters** that bring together diverse expertise to address complex problems. Collaboration initiatives expand networks with **industry partners** and **international programmes**, offering postgraduate students broader exposure and opportunities to participate in high-impact projects.

The presentation also highlights the importance of building pathways toward meaningful impact. These include fostering **innovation**, strengthening **training** in proposal, thesis, and grant writing, and enhancing industry-linked research that generates real societal value. Vision 2026 ultimately aims to help postgraduate students develop **versatile skills**, elevate **publication quality**, and enhance their global competitiveness in both academic and professional spheres.

Overall, the session encourages students to envision a future shaped by interdisciplinary collaboration, strong research culture, and diverse opportunities that support excellence and long-term success.
