# üìù **Exercise: Practical 6 ‚Äì Draft Refinement Workshop (Part 2)**

**Session Title:** From Outputs to Impact: Crafting a Compelling Narrative for UTM Reviewers

**Session Description:**

This second refinement session moves beyond the technical details to the heart of what makes a proposal win funding: its compelling narrative and clear value proposition. Based on the UTM 2025 grant guidelines, reviewers are not just assessing methodology; they are investing in the **impact** and **strategic alignment** of your project.

This hands-on session focuses on using Generative AI to refine the most influential yet often underdeveloped sections of your proposal: the **Impact Statement, Expected Outcomes,** and overall **Narrative Coherence**. We will ensure your proposal clearly articulates how it contributes to UTM's Signature Research Areas, fulfills mandatory output quotas, and delivers tangible benefits to society, industry, or knowledge itself.

**Session Objectives:**

By the end of this practical session, participants will be able to:
*   Distinguish between outputs and impact, and use AI to craft powerful, convincing impact statements aligned with UTM's strategic goals.
*   Refine expected outcomes to explicitly list mandatory deliverables (publications, human capital, external grants) as defined by their specific grant scheme.
*   Weave a golden thread of coherence throughout the proposal, ensuring the problem statement, aims, methodology, and impact are logically and compellingly connected.
*   Integrate specific elements required by UTM, such as the Quadruple Helix model (for KTP-RIG) and ethical AI use statements.

### **Detailed Session Breakdown & Activities:**

**Part 1: Crafting Powerful Impact Statements**

Impact answers the "So what?" question for the reviewer. It must be specific and meaningful.

*   **Activity 1: The "Impact Amplifier" Exercise:**
    *   **Task:** Participants write a initial draft of their project's impact.
    *   **Sample AI Prompt:** "Act as a grant reviewer focused on societal benefit. My project is about [project topic]. The direct output will be [main output]. Amplify this into a broader impact statement. How will this output change policies, improve industry practices, address a national priority, or solve a community problem? Suggest three specific impact pathways."
    *   **Group Debrief:** Discuss how to move from generic statements ("will contribute to knowledge") to specific, credible claims ("will provide the Johor water authority with a predictive AI model for pipe failure, reducing maintenance costs by an estimated 15%").

*   **Activity 2: Aligning with UTM's Signature Research Areas:**
    *   **Task:** Use AI to explicitly link the project's impact to one or more of the 9 UTM Signature Research Areas.
    *   **Sample Prompt:** "Map the impact of my project on [project topic] to the most relevant UTM Signature Research Area from this list: [List the 9 areas, e.g., Water Security, Smart Society]. Draft a sentence for the impact section that explicitly states this alignment."

**Part 2: Defining Precise Expected Outcomes**

Outcomes must be measurable, achievable, and directly fulfill the grant's mandatory requirements.

*   **Activity 3: The "Outcome Checklist" Alignment:**
    *   **Task:** Participants review their stated outcomes against the strict output tables from the slides (e.g., for AI Grant: 2 WoS Q1/Q2 publications, 2 Masters/1 PhD, compulsory external grant application).
    *   **Sample AI Prompt:** "I am applying for the Geran Penyelidikan Kecerdasan Buatan. Generate a bulleted list of 'Expected Outcomes' that explicitly includes: a) the exact number and tier of required journal publications, b) the type and number of postgraduate students to be enrolled, and c) the commitment to apply for an external grant. Use formal academic language."
    *   **Example Output:** "*Expected Outcomes:* This project is expected to yield: (1) Two (2) publications in Web of Science (Q1 or Q2) indexed journals; (2) The enrollment of one (1) full-time PhD student in the field of AI; (3) The development of a robust proof-of-concept to support a subsequent application to the [e.g., MRICA] grant scheme."

*   **Activity 4: Outcome-Driven Justification:**
    *   **Task:** Use AI to strengthen the rationale for the budget by linking costs directly to outcomes.
    *   **Sample Prompt:** "The budget includes RM X for a conference trip (V21000). Justify this expense not as travel, but as a critical activity for achieving the outcome of 'disseminating findings to an international audience and building collaborative networks for future grants.'"

**Part 3: Weaving the Golden Thread - Ensuring Proposal Coherence**

A winning proposal tells a seamless story from beginning to end.

*   **Activity 5: The "Narrative Consistency" Check:**
    *   **Task:** Participants paste their problem statement, aim, and methodology into the AI.
    *   **Sample AI Prompt:** "Review the following three sections from a grant proposal: 1) Problem Statement: [paste], 2) Research Aim: [paste], 3) Methodology: [paste]. Identify any gaps or inconsistencies in the logical flow. Does the methodology directly address the aim? Does the aim directly solve the problem stated? Provide a concise summary of the project's narrative arc."

*   **Activity 6: Creating a Cohesive Executive Summary:**
    *   **Task:** Use AI to synthesize the entire proposal into a powerful, one-paragraph summary that hooks the reviewer from the first sentence.
    *   **Sample Prompt:** "Based on the key points below, write a compelling executive summary for my grant proposal. Integrate these elements: The problem of [problem], the aim to [aim], using the method of [key method], to achieve [key outcome] and create impact by [impact]. Keep it under 150 words."

**Part 4: Special Focus for KTP-RIG Proposals**

*   **Activity 7: Framing Quadruple Helix Impact:**
    *   **Task:** For KTP-RIG applicants, use AI to articulate impact through the lens of the Quadruple Helix model (University-Industry-Government-Community).
    *   **Sample Prompt:** "My KTP-RIG project involves [project description]. Draft an impact statement that clearly defines the specific benefit for each of the four Quadruple Helix sectors: (1) Community: [benefit], (2) Industry: [benefit], (3) Government Agency: [benefit], (4) University (UTM): [benefit]."

**Materials Participants Should Bring:**
*   A laptop with access to a Generative AI tool.
*   A near-complete draft of their grant proposal, specifically the:
    *   Problem Statement & Aims
    *   Impact Statement section
    *   Expected Outcomes section
*   **Crucially:** The specific **output requirements table** and **strategic focus areas** for their target grant from the UTM slides.

**Note:** This session focuses on the strategic and narrative elements that transform a technically sound proposal into a compelling and fundable one, ensuring it resonates with the specific priorities of UTM's review panels.
