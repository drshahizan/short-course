# Practical 1: From Idea to Research Problem

**Laying the Foundation for a Winning UTM Proposal**

**Session Description:**

Every groundbreaking research project begins with a single, well-defined problem. This practical, hands-on session is the crucial first step in your grant-writing journey. We will move from a broad area of interest to a sharply focused research problem that is not only academically sound but also strategically aligned with **UTM's Signature Research Areas** and the specific objectives of the 2025 grant schemes (Fundamental, AI, New Researcher).

Using structured brainstorming techniques and Generative AI as a collaborative partner, you will learn to identify genuine research gaps, formulate compelling research questions, and define clear, achievable objectives. This session ensures your proposal's foundation is rock-solid, giving it the best chance to stand out in a competitive review process.

**Session Objectives:**

By the end of this practical session, participants will be able to:
*   Apply a structured framework to refine a broad research idea into a specific, researchable problem.
*   Use Generative AI effectively to scan the literature landscape and identify credible research gaps.
*   Craft precise, focused research questions and hypotheses that guide the entire project.
*   Define Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound (SMART) research objectives.
*   Clearly articulate the alignment of their research problem with UTM's strategic research themes and the specific goals of their target grant scheme.

### **Detailed Session Breakdown & Activities:**

**Part 1: From Broad Interest to Focused Problem**

The first step is narrowing the scope from a general topic to a specific, addressable problem.

*   **Activity 1: The "Problem Tree" Exercise:**
    *   **Task:** Participants start with a broad area of interest (e.g., "AI in healthcare," "Water purification," "Renewable energy").
    *   **Process:** Use a mind-mapping technique to break down the broad topic into core components, challenges, and unanswered questions. The goal is to identify a specific "trunk" of a problem from the wide "branches" of the field.
    *   **AI-Assisted Prompt:** "Act as a research consultant. Help me narrow down my broad research interest in [Broad Topic]. List 5 current major challenges or unresolved questions in this field. Then, for challenge # [X], suggest 3 more specific, researchable problems."

**Part 2: Identifying the Gap with AI Assistance**

A research problem is meaningless without a gap in existing knowledge.

*   **Activity 2: The "Literature Gap" Analysis:**
    *   **Task:** Participants use AI to simulate a preliminary literature review to find where knowledge ends and their research can begin.
    *   **Sample AI Prompt:** "The current literature on [Specific Problem] suggests that [Current Understanding]. However, there is a lack of studies investigating [Specific Aspect, e.g., its application in a tropical climate, its use with a new AI architecture, its socio-economic impact on rural communities]. This project aims to fill that gap by..."
    *   **Key Consideration:** Emphasize that AI is a starting point. Researchers must verify that the identified gap is genuine by checking actual scholarly databases.

**Part 3: Framing Research Questions and Objectives**

This is the core of the proposal‚Äîwhat will you actually do?

*   **Activity 3: Crafting the Golden Thread:**
    *   **Task:** Ensure a logical flow from the problem to the questions to the objectives.
    *   **Framework:**
        1.  **Problem:** There is a problem with X... because of Y... leading to consequence Z.
        2.  **Research Question:** Therefore, this study asks: "How can we solve/understand/improve X?"
        3.  **Objective:** To answer this, the objective is to [Specific, actionable verb: design, develop, evaluate, compare] [Specific thing].
    *   **AI-Assisted Prompt:** "Based on this research gap: '[Paste your identified gap]', generate 3 potential research questions. For the most promising question, draft 3 corresponding SMART objectives."

*   **Activity 4: Strategic Alignment with UTM & Grant Goals:**
    *   **Task:** Refine the problem and objectives to align with UTM's strategic goals and the specific grant's requirements.
    *   **Sample AI Prompt (for AI Grant):** "Review my research objective: '[Your Objective]'. How can I reframe it to stronger align with UTM's 'Smart Society' signature area and the Geran Penyelidikan Kecerdasan Buatan's goal of creating new theoretical discoveries in AI?"
    *   **Sample AI Prompt (for New Researcher Grant):** "Does this research objective seem feasible for a 24-month, RM20,000 project? Suggest ways to scale it to be more achievable for a new researcher."

**Materials Participants Should Bring:**
*   A laptop with access to a Generative AI tool (e.g., ChatGPT-4, Copilot, Gemini).
*   A notebook or digital document for brainstorming.
*   **Optional but encouraged:** A preliminary idea or area of research interest they are considering for their proposal.

**Note:** This session focuses on the critical "ideation" phase. A strong, well-defined problem is the most important element of a successful grant application. Using AI as a brainstorming partner can dramatically accelerate this process, but the final intellectual ownership of the problem must always reside with the researcher.
