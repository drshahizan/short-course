## 4. **Emerging Trends in UTM Research Funding**

### A. **Focus on UTM Signature Research Areas**

UTM‚Äôs funding increasingly emphasizes alignment with **nine signature areas**, such as **Next Generation Systems and Networks, Energy Sustainability, Water Security, Smart Society, Biomedical & Healthcare Engineering, Smart Manufacturing, and Smart Transportation**. Grants like **UTMFR** and **AI Research Grants** are evaluated on how strongly they contribute to these domains.

### B. **Artificial Intelligence (AI) as a Strategic Priority**

A dedicated **Geran Penyelidikan Kecerdasan Buatan** signals UTM‚Äôs commitment to becoming a regional leader in AI research. Trends include:

* Integration of **responsible and explainable AI (XAI/RAI)**.
* AI applications in **healthcare, education, IoT, and smart infrastructure**.
* Preference for **high-impact outputs (WoS Q1/Q2 journals)** and interdisciplinary collaborations.

### C. **Strengthening New Researcher Capacity**

Through the **Geran Penyelidik Baharu**, UTM nurtures young academics by:

* Encouraging them to publish **indexed papers early**.
* Requiring **external grant applications** as part of capacity building.
* Providing smaller-scale but structured funding (RM10k‚ÄìRM20k) to seed careers.

This shows a trend of **talent pipeline development** to ensure sustainability of UTM‚Äôs research ecosystem.

### D. **Knowledge Transfer & Societal Impact**

With **KTP-RIG 2026**, UTM is pivoting towards **community- and industry-engaged research**. Key trends include:

* **Quadruple Helix collaboration** (University‚ÄìIndustry‚ÄìGovernment‚ÄìCommunity).
* Emphasis on **real-world problem solving, commercialization, and policy impact**.
* Requirement for **matching funds** to increase financial sustainability.
* Deliverables like **community videos, star ratings, and visible societal benefits**.

This trend signals UTM‚Äôs **shift from purely academic outputs to measurable social impact**.

### E. **Networking and Global Collaboration**

The **Dana Networking AIMS4STAR** shows UTM‚Äôs strong push for **international visibility**. Trends include:

* Expanding **global research partnerships**.
* Building **consortiums** with international universities and industries.
* Securing **co-funding and industry-matching grants**.
* Prioritizing **long-term impact** beyond individual projects (e.g., joint publications, mobility, and networked innovation).

### F. **Stricter Accountability and Output Requirements**

Across all grants, UTM is tightening compliance:

* **Turnitin similarity index ‚â§20%** for proposals.
* **No extensions allowed** (strict timelines: 24‚Äì42 months).
* **Indexed publication requirements** tied to WoS/Scopus.
* **Mandatory external grant applications** to sustain funding cycles.
* Performance monitoring via **RADIS and ICEsys systems**.

This trend reflects a push towards **research integrity, efficiency, and global competitiveness**.

Here‚Äôs the revised version in **proper English** with clear timelines and deadlines for each UTM research grant (based on the *UTM Research Grant Briefing 2025*):
