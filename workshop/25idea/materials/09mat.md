# üìù **Session: Ethical AI Use & Roadmap to Submission**

**Navigating Integrity and Process for UTM Grant Success**

**Session Description:**

The final stretch from a completed draft to a successful submission is critical. This session provides the essential framework to cross the finish line with confidence and integrity. We directly address the urgent questions surrounding the use of Generative AI in grant writing within the specific context of **UTM's 2025 grant rules** and **research integrity policies**.

We will move from the "how" of using AI to the "**how to do it right**," tackling plagiarism, authorship, and verifiability. Then, we translate this ethical foundation into a practical, step-by-step roadmap for navigating UTM's submission portal (RADIS), adhering to strict deadlines, and ensuring your proposal is technically compliant and perfectly positioned for review.

**Session Objectives:**

By the end of this session, participants will be able to:
*   Articulate UTM's stance on AI use in research proposals and implement strategies to avoid plagiarism and uphold academic integrity.
*   Develop a transparent and acceptable disclosure statement for AI assistance in their proposals.
*   Navigate the **RADIS system** and adhere to the critical **25 September 2025** submission deadline.
*   Complete a comprehensive pre-submission checklist specific to UTM's grant requirements (e.g., Turnitin report, Quotations, Justifications).
*   Understand the post-submission review timeline and prepare for the next steps.

### **Detailed Session Breakdown:**

**Part 1: Ethical AI Use in UTM Grant Proposals**

This segment addresses the ethical "red flags" and ensures your use of AI strengthens, rather than undermines, your proposal's credibility.

**1. Addressing Plagiarism and Authenticity:**
*   **AI as an Assistant, Not an Author:** Emphasizing that AI-generated content is a tool for brainstorming and drafting. The **Principal Investigator (PI) is ultimately responsible for every word, claim, and citation**.
*   **The Verifiability Crisis:** AI can "hallucinate" or invent facts, citations, and data. We will discuss rigorous protocols to:
    *   **Fact-Check:** Every claim, especially methodological details and literature references, must be manually verified against original sources.
    *   **Cite Faithfully:** AI cannot be trusted to generate accurate citations. All references must be sourced and formatted by the researcher.
*   **Originality and Intellectual Contribution:** Strategies for using AI to overcome writer's block while ensuring the final narrative, theoretical framework, and intellectual argument are original and unmistakably your own.

**2. Upholding Research Integrity with UTM Policy:**
*   **Transparency and Disclosure:** *Should you disclose your use of AI?* Based on global research integrity norms and UTM's commitment to authenticity, **a brief, professional disclosure is the safest and most ethical strategy.**
    *   **Template for Disclosure Statement:** "Generative AI tools were used for initial drafting and brainstorming of certain sections. All content was rigorously verified, refined, and authored by the undersigned investigators. The AI was not used to generate data, analysis, or literature citations."
*   **Confidentiality and Data Security:** A critical warning: **Never input sensitive, unpublished, proprietary, or confidential data into public AI platforms.** Your groundbreaking research idea must remain secure.
*   **The 20% Similarity Index:** Directly addressing the mandatory **Turnitin report** requirement. Using AI without proper editing can lead to high similarity scores. We'll discuss strategies to ensure your final draft is original and passes this threshold.

**Part 2: The Roadmap to Submission on RADIS**

This segment provides a practical, step-by-step guide based on the official UTM timeline.

**1. The Pre-Submission Checklist (Based on UTM Attachment Requirements):**
*   **Mandatory Documents:** Ensure you have prepared:
    *   **Turnitin Similarity Report (**< **20%**)
    *   **Flow Chart** of research design
    *   **Quotation(s)** for any equipment or services (V35000)
    *   **Detailed Justification** for budget items (V35000, V21000, etc.)
    *   **CVs** of researchers
*   **The Golden Rule: Never Miss the Deadline.** The portal closes on **25 September 2025 (Khamis) at 5.00 petang.** Plan to submit at least **48 hours prior** to avoid last-minute technical issues.

**2. Navigating Institutional Hurdles:**
*   **Research Alliance Registration:** Confirm you are registered with the relevant Research Alliance (RA), as they lead the initial review process.
*   **Grants Office Coordination:** Engage with your school/faculty's research office and the **RMC** early for budget approvals (especially for V40000 - NYR Fees) and institutional assurances.

**3. The Final Quality Control Check:**
*   **Using AI for a Final Review:** Prompts for a last-minute compliance check:
    *   *"Review this budget justification for [V35000] to ensure it explicitly links the cost to a specific project aim and includes a reference to obtained quotations."*
    *   *"Does this methodology section clearly support the mandatory output of [e.g., 2 WoS Q1/Q2 publications] for the AI Grant?"*
    *   *"Check that the acknowledgement statement is included: 'Universiti Teknologi Malaysia, [Grant Name], cost center no.'"*
*   **The Human Review:** The irreplaceable value of having a colleague review the final draft for clarity and coherence.

**4. Understanding the Post-Submission Timeline:**
*   **Review Process:** Know what happens after you click "submit":
    *   **26 Sept - 9 Okt 2025:** Review by Research Alliances.
    *   **23 Oktober 2025:** Review by JPU (Jawatankuasa Penyelidikan Universiti).
    *   **30 Oktober 2025:** Announcement of results.
*   **Post-Award Steps:** Be prepared to activate the grant between **31 Okt - 6 Nov 2025** for a **1 Nov 2025** start date.

**Conclusion:**

Using Generative AI ethically is a strategic advantage. By combining its power with your expertise and a rigorous ethical framework, you create a proposal that is not only compelling but also unquestionably trustworthy. This session ensures your innovative approach is matched by flawless execution, giving you the greatest chance of success in the competitive UTM 2025 grant landscape.
