# üìù **Practical 5 ‚Äì Draft Refinement Workshop (Part 1)**

**Session Title:** Precision Engineering Your Proposal: AI-Assisted Refinement for UTM Grant Success

**Session Description:**

This hands-on, practical session is tailored specifically for the **UTM 2025 Grant Schemes** (Geran Penyelidik Baharu, UTMFR, Geran Penyelidikan Kecerdasan Buatan). We move from broad concepts to the precise details that reviewers from Research Alliances and RMC will scrutinize.

Bring your draft proposal! We will use Generative AI as a strategic partner to critically refine the core sections that demonstrate feasibility, rigor, and compliance: **Methodology, Work Plan, and Budget Justification**. You will leave with a strengthened, targeted draft that aligns perfectly with UTM's specific requirements and significantly boosts your chances of success.

**Session Objectives:**

By the end of this practical session, participants will be able to:
*   Employ targeted AI prompts to ensure their **Methodology** meets the specific publication output targets (e.g., WoS Q1/Q2 for AI Grant).
*   Use AI to develop a **Work Plan/Timeline** that logically sequences tasks to fit the strict grant durations (24, 30, or 42 months) and includes key milestones like GRA enrollment and reporting deadlines.
*   Craft a compelling **Budget Justification (V-Codes)** that explicitly links every cost (V21000, V27000, V35000, V40000) to a project activity and adheres to UTM's strict allocation limits (e.g., max 40% for V35000).
*   Integrate UTM's mandatory **acknowledgement language** and ethical disclosure statements into their draft.

### **Detailed Session Breakdown & Activities:**

**Part 1: Refining the Methodology for Mandatory Outputs**

The methodology must directly support the achievement of the non-negotiable publication outputs.

*   **Activity 1: The "Output-Alignment" Test:**
    *   **Task:** Participants paste their methodology section into an AI tool with a prompt designed to check alignment with their specific grant's output criteria.
    *   **Sample Prompt for AI Grant:** "Act as a UTM grant reviewer. This methodology aims to produce 2 WoS Q1/Q2 publications. Analyze the following section for a project on [topic]. Does it describe innovative enough processes, data collection, and analysis techniques to realistically yield such high-impact publications? Identify gaps and suggest specific methodological enhancements to strengthen the claim."
    *   **Group Debrief:** Compare feedback across different grant types (e.g., Baharu vs. AI Grant). Discuss how to elevate methodological descriptions to meet higher output tiers.

*   **Activity 2: GRA Integration Planning:**
    *   **Task:** Use AI to explicitly outline how the Graduate Research Assistant (GRA/NYR) will be integrated into the methodological workflow, as this is a key budget and human capital output.
    *   **Sample Prompt:** "Based on this methodology [paste text], generate a detailed description of the specific tasks and responsibilities for a Graduate Research Assistant (GRA) over a 24-month period, ensuring it directly contributes to the data collection and analysis described."

**Part 2: Building a Compliant Work Plan & Timeline**

The timeline must be realistic and demonstrate clear project management within the fixed duration.

*   **Activity 3: Duration-Specific Sequencing:**
    *   **Task:** Participants list their key project milestones (e.g., literature review, ethics approval, data collection, analysis, manuscript writing, conference travel).
    *   **Sample Prompt:** "Structure these tasks [list tasks] into a quarterly timeline for a 30-month UTMFR grant. Include critical administrative milestones: 'Submit 6-month Progress Report to RADIS,' 'Enroll PhD Student by Month 3,' 'Submit Final Report by Month 28.' Present as a Markdown table."

*   **Activity 4: Integrating Compulsory Requirements:**
    *   **Task:** Use AI to ensure the work plan includes activities related to mandatory obligations.
    *   **Sample Prompt:** "Add milestones to this timeline for 'Prepare and submit application for external grant (e.g., FRGS)' as per the compulsory requirement for UTMFR/AI grantees. Also add a task for 'Draft acknowledgement statement for publications: 'Universiti Teknologi Malaysia, [Grant Name], cost center no.'"

**Part 3: Crafting a V-Code Perfect Budget Justification**

Every line item must be justified and directly tied to a project activity, using the correct V-series codes.

*   **Activity 5: The "V-Code" Justification:**
    *   **Task:** Participants take a line from their budget (e.g., V35000: Equipment, RM15,000) and use AI to craft a UTM-compliant justification.
    *   **Sample Prompt:** "Write a justification for a budget item under **V35000** for a [Item Name] costing RM15,000. Link it explicitly to a specific project aim. Use the phrase: '*This is necessary for... therefore we are requesting... in order to achieve...*'. Mention that quotations have been obtained."
    *   **Example Output for AI Grant:** "This [Specific AI Software/GPU] is necessary for the deep learning model training described in Aim 2, therefore we are requesting RM15,000 under V35000 in order to achieve the project's objective of developing a high-accuracy prediction model. Three quotations have been obtained."

*   **Activity 6: Stress-Testing for Compliance:**
    *   **Task:** Use AI to act as a financial officer and check for common budget mistakes.
    *   **Sample Prompt:** "Review the following budget justification for compliance with standard UTM rules: 'RM10,000 under V21000 for international conference travel.' Identify potential issues. Should this be reduced or specified further? Remember: ASEAN travel only for students, max 20% allocation for travel."

**Materials Participants Should Bring:**
*   A laptop with access to a Generative AI tool (e.g., ChatGPT-4, Copilot, Gemini).
*   Their current grant proposal draft.
*   **Crucially:** The specific guidelines for their target grant (Baharu, UTMFR, or AI) from the presentation, particularly the **Output Tables** and **Budget (V-Code) Tables**.

**Note:** This session emphasizes using AI to achieve **compliance** and **strategic alignment** with the very specific requirements of UTM's internal grant schemes, moving beyond generic proposal advice.
