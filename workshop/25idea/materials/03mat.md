# Practical 2: Using Generative AI for Drafting Problem Statements and Objectives in Grant Proposals

**Accelerating and Elevating Your Writing with AI Co-pilots**

**Session Description:**

The initial blank page can be the biggest hurdle in proposal writing. This practical, hands-on session tackles that hurdle head-on by turning Generative AI from a novel tool into a practical co-pilot. We will move from a defined research problem to a structured, compelling draft of core proposal sections.

Participants will get hands-on experience using popular AI platforms (**ChatGPT, Gemini, Copilot, NotebookLM**) to generate, refine, and enhance the critical building blocks of a grant proposal: the **Problem Statement, Background, and Research Objectives**. This session is not about letting AI write for you; it's about learning to command it effectively to articulate your ideas with greater clarity, impact, and speed, all while maintaining your unique intellectual voice.

**Session Objectives:**

By the end of this practical session, participants will be able to:
*   Compare the strengths of different AI tools (e.g., ChatGPT for creativity, NotebookLM for source-based analysis) for specific drafting tasks.
*   Apply advanced prompting techniques to generate structured and nuanced text for key proposal sections.
*   Critically evaluate and refine AI-generated content to ensure accuracy, originality, and alignment with their research vision.
*   Integrate AI-generated drafts into their own writing process to create a cohesive and powerful narrative.
*   Initiate a full first draft of their proposal's foundational sections.

### **Detailed Session Breakdown & Activities:**

**Guiding Principle:** AI is a powerful **drafting assistant and thought partner**. You are the **domain expert, editor, and final author**.

**Part 1: Tool Setup and Introductory Prompting**

*   **Activity 1: The "Perfect Prompt" Formula:**
    *   **Task:** Learn and practice a structured prompt formula to get high-quality outputs.
    *   **Formula:** **Role + Context + Task + Format**
    *   **Example:** "Act as a senior research professor [Role]. My research is in biopolymer engineering for water filtration, aligned with UTM's Water Security theme [Context]. Draft a problem statement that highlights the gap in sustainable filtering materials [Task]. Output in two concise paragraphs [Format]."

**Part 2: Hands-On Drafting with Different AI Tools**

Participants will rotate through core drafting activities, using different tools to compare their utility.

*   **Activity 2: Crafting a Compelling Problem Statement:**
    *   **Goal:** Generate a draft that establishes urgency, context, and the research gap.
    *   **Sample Prompt (for any tool):** "Write a problem statement for a grant proposal. The core problem is [state your specific problem]. The significance is [state why it matters]. The current solutions are inadequate because [state the gap]. Write it to be persuasive to an academic review panel."
    *   **Tool-Specific Tip:** Use **NotebookLM** to first upload key papers and then ask it to help identify and articulate the research gap based on the provided literature.

*   **Activity 3: Defining Precise Research Objectives:**
    *   **Goal:** Generate clear, actionable, and measurable objectives.
    *   **Sample Prompt (for any tool):** "Based on this research question: '[Your Research Question]', generate 3 specific research objectives. Use actionable verbs like 'to design,' 'to evaluate,' 'to quantify.' Ensure they are SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound)."
    *   **Tool-Specific Tip:** Use **Copilot** (with web access enabled) to check if your objectives align with the standard language used in successful grants in your field.

*   **Activity 4: Generating a Background/Introduction Outline:**
    *   **Goal:** Create a logical structure for the introduction section.
    *   **Sample Prompt (for any tool):** "Create a detailed outline for the introduction chapter of a research proposal on [Your Topic]. Include sections for: 1. Broad background, 2. Review of key literature, 3. Identification of the specific gap, 4. Statement of the problem, 5. Research objectives and hypotheses."

**Part 3: Critical Evaluation and Refinement**

*   **Activity 5: The "AEIOU" Refinement Method:**
    *   **Task:** Critically review the AI-generated draft. Don't just accept it; improve it.
    *   **A - Add** your expert knowledge and specific details.
    *   **E - Eliminate** generic fluff, jargon, or incorrect assumptions.
    *   **I - Improve** the flow, logic, and academic tone.
    *   **O - Organize** the structure to best tell your story.
    *   **U - Verify** every claim and fact; AI "hallucinates".

*   **Activity 6: Using AI for Self-Critique:**
    *   **Task:** Use the AI to critique its own output or your refined draft.
    *   **Sample Prompt:** "Now, act as a critical grant reviewer. Analyze the problem statement I just drafted: '[Paste your text]'. Identify its weakest argument and suggest two ways to strengthen it."

**Materials Participants Should Bring:**
*   A laptop with access to several AI tools (e.g., free accounts for ChatGPT, Gemini, Copilot; access to NotebookLM).
*   Their defined **Research Problem and Objectives** from Practical 1.
*   **Optional:** 1-2 key academic papers relevant to their research topic (for use with NotebookLM).

**Note:** This session is highly interactive. The goal is to leave with a significantly advanced draft and the skills to continue using AI as a productive writing partner, while strictly avoiding plagiarism and maintaining research integrity.
