# Practical 2: Using Generative AI for Drafting Problem Statements and Objectives in Grant Proposals

## Session Structure
This interactive workshop is designed to guide participants through hands-on activities and discussions, emphasizing the use of AI tools to streamline the drafting process for problem statements and objectives.

### 1. Introduction to AI Tools for Grant Writing (10 minutes)
- **Overview**: Explain how AI tools (ChatGPT, Gemini, Copilot, NotebookLM) can assist in drafting grant proposal components, particularly problem statements and objectives.
  - **Problem Statements**: AI can help articulate the significance, urgency, and context of an issue.
  - **Objectives**: AI can generate SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound) objectives aligned with project goals.
- **Tool Comparison**:
  - **ChatGPT**: Versatile for generating narrative text; excels in creative and structured outputs with clear prompts.
  - **Gemini**: Strong in contextual understanding; ideal for concise and focused responses.
  - **Copilot**: Integrated with Microsoft tools; useful for professional and structured drafting.
  - **NotebookLM**: Best for synthesizing research-based content; suitable for evidence-backed problem statements.
- **Example**: Demonstrate drafting a problem statement using ChatGPT with the prompt: ‚ÄúWrite a 150-word problem statement for a grant proposal addressing food insecurity in rural communities, emphasizing its impact and urgency.‚Äù

### 2. Hands-On Activity: Drafting Problem Statements with AI Tools (25 minutes)
- **Activity**:
  - Participants are provided with a grant scenario (e.g., a project addressing climate change adaptation, healthcare access, or STEM education).
  - Using one or more AI tools (ChatGPT, Gemini, Copilot, or NotebookLM), participants draft a problem statement with the following prompt:
    - ‚ÄúWrite a compelling problem statement (150-200 words) for a grant proposal on [specific topic], highlighting the issue‚Äôs significance, its impact on the target community, and the urgent need for intervention. Use evidence-based language and align with grant guidelines.‚Äù
  - Participants compare outputs from different tools, noting variations in tone, detail, and clarity.
- **Guidance**:
  - Emphasize crafting specific prompts, e.g., including word count, tone (persuasive, formal), and context (target audience, grant focus).
  - Encourage participants to refine AI outputs for alignment with grant requirements, ensuring factual accuracy and coherence.
- **Example Prompt**:
  - ‚ÄúUsing NotebookLM, synthesize research data into a 200-word problem statement for a grant proposal on improving mental health services for urban youth, citing relevant statistics and challenges.‚Äù

### 3. Hands-On Activity: Drafting SMART Objectives with AI Tools (25 minutes)
- **Activity**:
  - Participants use AI tools to draft SMART objectives for the same grant scenario, using prompts like:
    - ‚ÄúGenerate three SMART objectives for a grant proposal on [specific topic], ensuring they are specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound.‚Äù
  - Participants test different tools (e.g., Gemini for concise objectives, Copilot for structured outputs) and compare results.
  - Example output for a literacy project:
    - Objective 1: Train 50 teachers in digital literacy techniques by June 2026, achieving a 90% completion rate.
    - Objective 2: Increase reading proficiency by 20% among 200 primary school students by December 2026, measured by standardized tests.
    - Objective 3: Establish 10 community reading hubs by March 2027, serving at least 500 families annually.
- **Guidance**:
  - Teach participants to specify the SMART criteria in prompts to ensure precise outputs.
  - Highlight the need to edit AI-generated objectives for clarity, feasibility, and alignment with project goals.

### 4. Building a Prompt Bank for Problem Statements and Objectives (20 minutes)
- **Overview**:
  - A prompt bank is a collection of reusable, tailored prompts for generating grant proposal components. It saves time and ensures consistency across proposals.
- **Activity**:
  - Participants create prompts for problem statements and objectives, such as:
    - **Problem Statement**: ‚ÄúWrite a 150-200 word problem statement for a grant proposal on [topic], addressing the issue‚Äôs scope, evidence of need, and potential impact on [target group]. Use a formal tone and include one relevant statistic.‚Äù
    - **Objectives**: ‚ÄúGenerate three SMART objectives for a grant proposal on [topic], ensuring each is specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound, with a focus on [specific outcome].‚Äù
  - Participants share and refine their prompts, building a shared bank for future use.
- **Example Additional Prompts**:
  - ‚ÄúUsing Gemini, draft a 100-word problem statement for a grant proposal on [topic], emphasizing stakeholder needs and project urgency.‚Äù
  - ‚ÄúUsing Copilot, create five SMART objectives for a [topic] project, ensuring alignment with a $100,000 budget and a 12-month timeline.‚Äù

### 5. Discussion and Reflection (10 minutes)
- **Group Discussion**:
  - Participants share their experiences with different AI tools, discussing strengths (e.g., ChatGPT‚Äôs narrative flow, NotebookLM‚Äôs research synthesis) and challenges (e.g., vague outputs from broad prompts).
  - Explore strategies to overcome issues, such as iterative prompt refinement or cross-tool comparisons.
- **Ethical Considerations**:
  - Stress that AI is a tool to assist, not replace, human creativity and rigor.
  - Encourage fact-checking, plagiarism checks, and tailoring outputs to reflect the organization‚Äôs voice and goals.

## Learning Outcomes
By the end of this practical, participants will:
1. Be proficient in using AI tools (ChatGPT, Gemini, Copilot, NotebookLM) to draft problem statements and SMART objectives for grant proposals.
2. Develop a reusable prompt bank tailored for grant writing, enhancing efficiency in future proposals.
3. Understand how to refine AI-generated content to meet grant guidelines, ensuring clarity, accuracy, and impact.
4. Gain confidence in integrating AI tools into their grant writing workflow while maintaining ethical standards.

## Additional Recommendations
- **Tools Access**: Ensure participants have access to at least one AI tool (e.g., free versions of ChatGPT or Gemini) during the session.
- **Resources**: Provide sample grant guidelines and a template prompt bank to kickstart activities.
- **Follow-Up**: Assign participants to draft a full problem statement and three SMART objectives using their preferred AI tool, submitting them for feedback.
