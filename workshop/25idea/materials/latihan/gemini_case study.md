# Case Study: Producing an Article on the Strategic Direction of the Department of Statistics Malaysia Towards 2035

This case study exercise is designed to guide participants through a structured process of deep research, analysis, and writing. The goal is to produce a well-researched article (approximately 1,500-2,000 words) that explores the current and projected strategic direction ("halatuju") of the Department of Statistics Malaysia (DOSM). While DOSM's official strategic plan covers 2021-2025, participants will extend this to 2035 by analyzing national development plans, global trends in statistics, and DOSM's role in supporting Malaysia's long-term goals, such as achieving developed nation status by 2030 and aligning with Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). 

The exercise emphasizes deep research using credible sources like official government websites, reports, academic journals, and international organizations (e.g., UN, World Bank). Avoid unsubstantiated claims; cite sources properly using a standard format like APA or MLA. This exercise can be completed individually or in groups over 1-2 weeks.

To facilitate deep research, I've added sample prompts below for each step. These can be used as search queries (e.g., for web search engines) or as instructions/prompts for AI tools (e.g., for summarizing browsed pages or generating insights). Adapt them as needed to refine your research.

#### Step 1: Understand the Background and Role of DOSM
- **Objective**: Build foundational knowledge about DOSM to contextualize its strategic direction.
- **Tasks**:
  - Research DOSM's history, mandate, and organizational structure. Start with the official website (https://www.dosm.gov.my/) and key documents like the Statistics Act 1965 (Revised 1989).
  - Identify DOSM's core functions, such as data collection, analysis, and dissemination for economic, social, and environmental indicators.
  - Note its vision: "Leader in Statistical Services for Universal Prosperity" (from the 2021-2025 Strategic Plan).
- **Deep Research Tips**: Use web searches for "Department of Statistics Malaysia overview" or browse DOSM's "About Us" section. Cross-reference with reports from the United Nations Statistics Division or Paris21 (an international partnership for statistics). Collect at least 3-5 sources.
- **Sample Prompts**:
  - Web search query: "History and mandate of Department of Statistics Malaysia DOSM"
  - AI prompt for summarization (e.g., when browsing a page): "Summarize the key historical milestones, organizational structure, and legal mandate of DOSM from this page, focusing on its role in national data governance."
  - Research expansion prompt: "Provide an overview of how national statistical offices like DOSM contribute to economic policymaking, with examples from Malaysia."
- **Expected Output**: A 1-page summary of DOSM's background, including its contributions to national policymaking (e.g., providing data for GDP calculations or population projections).

#### Step 2: Review DOSM's Current Strategic Plan (2021-2025)
- **Objective**: Analyze the existing framework to identify ongoing priorities that could extend into the future.
- **Tasks**:
  - Download and review the full Strategic Plan 2021-2025 from DOSM's publications portal (available in Malay and English summaries). Focus on key thrusts like enhancing data quality, adopting big data analytics (e.g., via the StatsBDA Portal), and improving statistical literacy.
  - Examine how this plan builds on previous ones, such as the Transformation Plan 2015-2020, which emphasized modernization and relevance in a changing socio-economic landscape.
  - Identify objectives, strategies, and any performance indicators mentioned (e.g., increasing data timeliness or user satisfaction).
- **Deep Research Tips**: Search for "DOSM Strategic Plan 2021-2025 PDF" to access the document. Compare it with the Malaysia Statistical Training Institute's aligned plan for insights on capacity building. If the plan references international standards (e.g., UN Fundamental Principles of Official Statistics), explore those for context.
- **Sample Prompts**:
  - Web search query: "DOSM Strategic Plan 2021-2025 full document PDF"
  - AI prompt for analysis: "Extract and list the main objectives, strategies, and key performance indicators from the DOSM 2021-2025 Strategic Plan, highlighting elements related to digital transformation and data quality."
  - Comparison prompt: "Compare DOSM's 2021-2025 plan with its 2015-2020 Transformation Plan, identifying evolutions in priorities like big data adoption."
- **Expected Output**: A bullet-point list of 5-7 key elements from the plan, with notes on how they address current challenges like digital transformation or data privacy.

#### Step 3: Analyze National and International Plans Influencing DOSM
- **Objective**: Connect DOSM's direction to broader Malaysian and global agendas, projecting towards 2035.
- **Tasks**:
  - Review Malaysia's national development plans: The Twelfth Malaysia Plan (2021-2025) for post-COVID recovery, and the Thirteenth Malaysia Plan (2026-2030) for achieving high-income status by 2030. Note DOSM's role in providing data for these (e.g., population projections showing Malaysia reaching 36.4 million by 2030 and becoming an "aged nation" by 2048).
  - Explore alignments with the Shared Prosperity Vision 2030 (Wawasan Kemakmuran Bersama 2030) and the SDG Roadmap for Malaysia Phase II (2021-2025), including DOSM's contributions to SDG indicators (e.g., poverty reduction, gender equality).
  - Investigate long-term projections: For instance, Malaysia's renewable energy roadmap or the National Strategic Plan to End TB (aiming for TB-free status by 2035), and how DOSM supports monitoring through statistics.
  - Consider global trends: Look at UN SDGs (targeting 2030 but with implications to 2035) and how national statistical offices like DOSM are adapting to Agenda 2030.
- **Deep Research Tips**: Use sources like the Economic Planning Unit (EPU) website (https://www.epu.gov.my/), UN Sustainable Development Goals reports for Malaysia, or web searches for "Malaysia Thirteenth Plan DOSM role." Gather data on demographic shifts (e.g., ageing population) from DOSM's own reports. Aim for 5-10 diverse sources, including government PDFs and international analyses.
- **Sample Prompts**:
  - Web search query: "Thirteenth Malaysia Plan 2026-2030 DOSM role in data provision site:epu.gov.my"
  - AI prompt for synthesis: "Analyze how DOSM aligns with Malaysia's Shared Prosperity Vision 2030 and UN SDGs, including specific indicators DOSM tracks for poverty and environmental goals."
  - Projection prompt: "Project DOSM's involvement in long-term national plans like renewable energy roadmaps or demographic ageing in Malaysia towards 2035, based on current data trends."
- **Expected Output**: A table summarizing 4-6 key national/international plans, with columns for "Plan Name," "Timeframe," "Key Goals," and "DOSM's Potential Role" (e.g., data provision for economic forecasting).

#### Step 4: Identify Emerging Trends and Project DOSM's Future Direction
- **Objective**: Use research to forecast DOSM's halatuju towards 2035, beyond current plans.
- **Tasks**:
  - Research trends in official statistics: Focus on digitalization (e.g., AI for data analysis, blockchain for data security), big data integration, open data initiatives, and climate-related statistics (e.g., for net-zero goals post-2030).
  - Project DOSM's evolution: Based on current plans, speculate on extensions like strengthening the National Statistical System (NSS) for better administrative data use, or enhancing real-time data for policy responses (e.g., to economic disruptions).
  - Consider challenges: Address issues like data gaps in informal sectors, cybersecurity, or inclusivity for marginalized groups, and how DOSM might tackle them by 2035.
  - Align with Malaysia's aspirations: Link to becoming a developed nation by 2030, with post-2030 focus on sustainability and innovation.
- **Deep Research Tips**: Search for "future of national statistics offices 2030-2035" or "DOSM big data analytics." Reference reports from the World Bank, OECD, or ESCAP (Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific). Include case studies from other countries (e.g., Singapore's statistics department) for comparative insights.
- **Sample Prompts**:
  - Web search query: "Emerging trends in national statistics offices AI big data 2030-2035 site:worldbank.org OR site:oecd.org"
  - AI prompt for forecasting: "Based on global trends, project how DOSM might evolve its strategic direction by 2035, including adoption of AI, blockchain, and real-time data systems for sustainability goals."
  - Challenge analysis prompt: "Identify key challenges for DOSM towards 2035, such as cybersecurity and data inclusivity, and suggest potential strategies drawing from international best practices."
- **Expected Output**: A mind map or outline of 3-5 projected directions (e.g., "AI-Driven Statistics by 2035"), supported by evidence from research.

#### Step 5: Synthesize Research and Outline the Article
- **Objective**: Organize findings into a coherent structure for writing.
- **Tasks**:
  - Compile all notes, summaries, and projections from previous steps.
  - Create an article outline: Introduction (DOSM overview and thesis on 2035 direction), Body (current plan analysis, national alignments, trends and projections), Conclusion (recommendations for DOSM).
  - Ensure balance: 40% on current status, 40% on projections, 20% on implications.
- **Deep Research Tips**: Verify facts with multiple sources to avoid bias. Use tools like Google Scholar for academic papers on statistical modernization in Southeast Asia.
- **Sample Prompts**:
  - Synthesis prompt: "Synthesize research on DOSM's current plan and national alignments to create a thesis statement on its strategic direction towards 2035."
