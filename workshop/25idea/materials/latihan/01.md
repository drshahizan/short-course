# Step-by-Step Guide: Using Scopus AI to Develop "From Idea to Research Problem"

Scopus AI, powered by generative AI from Elsevier, is an excellent tool for transforming a vague research idea into a well-defined research problem. It draws from the Scopus database (over 87 million documents from 7,000+ publishers) to provide summaries, identify gaps, suggest hypotheses, and more. Based on its features, here's how to use it step by step for this purpose. I'll simulate the process with example outputs derived from its capabilities and relevant scholarly insights gathered from reliable sources.

## Step 1: Access Scopus AI
- Navigate to the Scopus homepage (www.scopus.com) and log in (requires institutional access or subscription).
- Click on the "Scopus AI" tab to enter the interface.
- This sets you up for natural language queries‚Äîno need for Boolean operators or keywords.

## Step 2: Formulate and Enter Your Initial Query
- Start with a broad natural language query related to your idea. For "From Idea to Research Problem," enter something like: "How can researchers transform a vague idea into a well-defined research problem, including identifying gaps, framing questions, and defining objectives?"
- Scopus AI's Copilot processes this by breaking it down (e.g., vector search for concepts like "research gaps" and keyword search for "framing questions"). It translates non-English queries if needed and corrects spelling.
- Why this step? It helps Scopus AI generate a baseline summary while suggesting refinements.

Example Output from Scopus AI (Simulated based on features):
- **Topic Summary**: Transforming a research idea into a problem involves reviewing literature for gaps, using frameworks like FINER criteria for questions, and SMART for objectives. Key challenges include ensuring novelty and feasibility.

## Step 3: Review the Summary and References
- Scopus AI provides a concise **Summary** (synthesized from abstracts since 2013, up to 10 references) and an **Expanded Summary** (deeper sub-topics).
- Check the **References** list for sources contributing to the summary. Click titles for abstracts or full Scopus details.
- Focus on how this identifies gaps: Look for mentions of underexplored areas, like methodological challenges in idea refinement.

Example Insights:
- A research problem should be novel, addressing knowledge voids through literature review.
- Sources of problems include personal experience, literature gaps, or practical issues.

## Step 4: Explore Foundational Documents
- View **Foundational Documents**: These are highly cited papers influencing the summary (e.g., top-cited works on research methodology).
- Use this to build your problem: Identify seminal ideas, like turning observations into testable questions.
- Toggle abstracts and export in formats like RIS for reference managers.

Example:
- Influential paper: "From ideas to studies: how to get ideas and sharpen them into research questions" ‚Äì Emphasizes roaming fields for inspiration and iterative refinement.

## Step 5: Visualize with Concept Maps
- Open the **Concept Map**: An interactive visual of keywords and connections (e.g., "research idea" linking to "gap analysis," "hypothesis formulation").
- Click nodes to explore branches, revealing relationships like how SWOT analysis aids gap identification.
- Download as PNG. This helps spot "white spaces" for your problem.

Example Map Branches:
- Idea ‚Üí Literature Review ‚Üí Gaps ‚Üí Questions (e.g., FINER criteria: Feasible, Interesting, Novel, Ethical, Relevant).

## Step 6: Identify Emerging Themes and Hypotheses
- Use **Emerging Themes**: Scans recent documents (last 2 years) for established, rising, or novel themes. Includes mini-summaries and suggested hypotheses.
- This is key for framing your problem: Look for rising themes like AI-assisted gap identification.
- Hypotheses might suggest: "Iterative AI tools can reduce time in problem formulation by 50%."

Example Themes:
- Rising: Action research for practical problems.
- Novel: Using thematic analysis to build conceptual models from ideas.

## Step 7: Go Deeper with Follow-Ups and Conversational Queries
- Use suggested **Go Deeper** questions (e.g., "What frameworks help frame research questions from ideas?") or enter your own (e.g., "Examples of turning methodological dilemmas into research problems").
- Conversational history saves chats; rename or delete as needed.
- Refine iteratively: If the summary is broad, ask specifics like "Apply PICO framework to idea refinement."

## Step 8: Use Deep Research for Comprehensive Reports
- For complex queries, switch to **Deep Research** (new feature as of 2025): Enter your refined query and add parameters (e.g., "Focus on studies from 2020-2025, include only review articles").
- Generates a detailed report with gaps, limitations, and next steps (e.g., "Research plan: Conduct SWOT on idea, then formulate RQ using FINER").
- Tips: Be specific with context; refine with filters for feasibility.

Example Report Snippet:
- Gaps: Limited studies on AI in proposal writing; opportunity for interdisciplinary work.

## Step 9: Identify Topic Experts and Collaborate
- Check **Topic Experts**: Lists leading authors with metrics (e.g., h-index) and their contributions.
- Contact experts via Scopus profiles for feedback on your problem.

Example:
- Expert: S. Hulley ‚Äì Known for "Designing Clinical Research," emphasizing FINER for questions.

## Step 10: Iterate, Save, and Export
- Review history on mobile/desktop for synchronization.
- Export summaries, maps, and references.
- Ethical note: Cite Scopus AI usage; avoid hallucinations by cross-verifying references.
- If results are insufficient, Scopus AI suggests alternatives (e.g., "Try broadening to 'research methodology frameworks'").

By following these steps, Scopus AI helps turn your idea into a research problem efficiently‚Äîoften in minutes. For instance, it might conclude with a refined problem: "How can generative AI bridge gaps in grant proposal ideation for early-career researchers?" If you lack access, similar insights can come from open tools like Google Scholar, but Scopus provides peer-reviewed depth. For more, consult the Quick Reference Guide or blog tips.
