# **Population Forecasting for Malaysia**

### 🎯 **Objectives**

* To understand the basic concepts of **forecasting** using statistical data.
* To explore how **Deepseek can assist in generating projections and analyzing population trends**.
* To apply real population data for **policy-making, budget planning, and human resource management**.


### 📌 **Real Data: Population of Malaysia (Source: Department of Statistics Malaysia)**

| Year | Total Population (millions) |
| ---- | --------------------------: |
| 2015 |                       30.33 |
| 2016 |                       31.19 |
| 2017 |                       32.02 |
| 2018 |                       32.58 |
| 2019 |                       32.98 |
| 2020 |  32.75 *(COVID-19 decline)* |
| 2021 |                       32.66 |
| 2022 |                       32.78 |
| 2023 |                       33.42 |
| 2024 |          33.90 *(estimate)* |
| 2025 |          34.40 *(estimate)* |


### 💬 **Prompt 1: Linear Forecast of Malaysia’s Population up to 2035**

```
Using Malaysia’s population data from 2015 to 2025, forecast the population for the years 2030 and 2035 
using a linear growth approach. Show the calculations clearly and explain the growth trend.
```

### 💬 **Prompt 2: Line Chart of Projected Population Growth (2025–2035)**

```
Generate a line chart showing Malaysia’s projected population growth from 2025 to 2035, 
using the average annual growth rate derived from the 2015–2025 data.
```

### 💬 **Prompt 3: Policy Impact Analysis of Population Growth**

```
Assuming Malaysia’s population is projected to exceed 38 million by 2035, 
recommend three policy strategies in healthcare, education, and housing to address this demographic shift.
```

### 💬 **Prompt 4: Annual Population Projection Table (2025–2035)**

```
Build a table projecting Malaysia’s annual population from 2025 to 2035, 
assuming an average annual growth rate of 1.2%. Present the population figures year by year.
```

### 💬 **Prompt 5: Optimistic vs. Pessimistic Scenarios**

```
Using the 2015–2025 dataset, create two projections up to 2035:
- Optimistic Scenario: 1.5% annual growth rate
- Pessimistic Scenario: 0.8% annual growth rate
Present both projections in a comparative table and line chart.
```

### 💬 **Prompt 6: Pie Chart of Age Composition in 2035**

```
Based on the 2035 projection, assume the following age distribution:
0–14 years: 22%, 15–64 years: 68%, 65 years and above: 10%.
Generate a pie chart and discuss the implications for workforce planning and public health policy.
```

### 💬 **Prompt 7: ASEAN Comparison**

```
Compare Malaysia’s projected 2035 population (38 million) with projections for other ASEAN countries 
(e.g., Indonesia, Thailand, Vietnam). Create a comparative table and suggest opportunities 
for regional cooperation in economics and education.
```

### 💬 **Prompt 8: Moving Average Forecast (MA = 3 years)**

```
Using Malaysia’s population data from 2015–2025, apply a 3-year moving average (MA=3) 
to forecast the population for 2026–2030. Present the results in both a table and line chart.
```

### 💬 **Prompt 9: Executive Report Narrative**

```
Prepare a one-page executive summary report on Malaysia’s population projections (2015–2035). 
Use formal language, include a graph, and highlight implications for higher education policies 
and labor market dynamics.
```

### 💬 **Prompt 10: Interactive Dashboard Concept**

```
Design a conceptual interactive dashboard to monitor Malaysia’s population projections (2015–2035). 
Specify the main charts (line, pie, bar), filters (year, age group, state), and explain its usefulness 
for policymakers.
```


✅ This exercise integrates **real-world data with Deepseek’s forecasting capabilities**, helping participants not only learn statistical forecasting methods but also connect them with **policy, planning, and decision-making contexts**.
