# NotebookLM Guide

NotebookLM is Google's AI-powered research and analysis tool, designed to help users interact with and synthesize information from multiple documents. It is particularly valuable for daily work at the Department of Statistics Malaysia (DOSM), such as analyzing survey reports, economic data, population censuses, or policy briefs. By uploading statistical sources, it generates summaries, extracts key insights, and facilitates comparisons—streamlining tasks like data validation, trend identification, and report preparation. As of November 2025, NotebookLM features significant upgrades, including a 1 million token context window for handling larger datasets, enhanced chat memory for prolonged interactions, customizable response styles, and new tools like Magic View for infographic generation and Fast Research for quick overviews. It remains free for all Google account users, with seamless integration to Google Drive for accessing DOSM-shared files.

### 1. Creating a New Notebook
- Sign in to your Google account and visit [https://notebooklm.google.com](https://notebooklm.google.com).
- Create a new notebook with a descriptive name, e.g., "DOSM 2025 Economic Indicators Analysis."
- Upload up to 50 sources, such as statistical reports or datasets. NotebookLM automatically generates an initial summary and suggested questions for each uploaded document, aiding quick daily reviews.

### 2. Uploading Sources
- Add relevant DOSM materials in supported formats:
  - **PDFs**: Ideal for official reports, census documents, or survey results.
  - **Google Docs & Slides**: For internal notes, draft analyses, or presentation outlines.
  - **Text Files & Copied Text**: For raw data excerpts, CSV summaries, or quick statistical notes.
  - **Web URLs**: To fetch and analyze online content, like government websites or international stats pages.
  - **YouTube Videos**: For transcribing and analyzing webinars on statistical methodologies.
  - **Audio Files**: For processing recordings of meetings or data discussions.
- NotebookLM processes uploads instantly, providing summaries and query suggestions—perfect for daily data ingestion in DOSM workflows.

### 3. Interacting with Documents
- Use the chat panel to query your sources for targeted insights, leveraging the expanded 1 million token context for complex statistical analyses.
  - **Summarization**: Condense single or multiple documents.
    - *Prompt examples*: "Summarize the key findings from the 2024 Household Income Survey PDF." or "Synthesize trends from the three economic reports on GDP growth."
  - **Information Extraction**: Pull specific data points or metrics.
    - *Prompt examples*: "Extract all unemployment statistics from these labor force reports." or "List the top five demographic shifts from the population census data."
  - **Cross-Document Comparison**: Identify patterns, discrepancies, or correlations.
    - *Prompt examples*: "Compare inflation methodologies across the CPI reports." or "What common trends emerge in trade data from all uploaded sources?"

### 4. Generating Content and Organizing Notes
- Save AI responses as **Notes** for easy reference in daily tasks.
- Create structured outputs using new features like customizable tones or Learning Guide Style.
  - **Save Insights**: Pin useful responses, such as data extractions, to the notes panel.
  - **Structured Documents**: Generate guides or briefs.
    - *Prompt example*: "Create a briefing document on sustainable development indicators from these reports." or "Generate a FAQ on statistical sampling techniques."
  - **Audio Overviews**: Produce podcast-style discussions for auditory review of complex stats.
  - **Infographics with Magic View**: Use the updated banner tool to visualize data trends quickly.

### 5. Using AI Chat for Initial Queries
- Start with broad questions in the chat panel for high-level overviews, enhanced by longer memory for iterative DOSM analyses.
  - *Examples*: "What are the key themes in these inflation and employment datasets?" or "Summarize the main arguments in the latest trade balance report."

### 6. Combining Sources and Summarizing in Tables
- For comparative analysis, craft prompts requesting table formats to organize statistical data efficiently.
  - **Specific Prompt**: Define structure clearly.
    - *Example*: "Create a table comparing the three uploaded GDP reports. Columns: 'Report 1', 'Report 2', 'Report 3'. Rows: 'Growth Rate', 'Sector Contributions', 'Forecasts'."
  - **Review and Refine**: Check accuracy and refine, e.g., "Add a row for 'Data Sources' in the table."

### 7. Saving Key Insights to Notes
- Use the "Save to Note" button for valuable outputs, building a curated library of statistical findings. Add manual notes to incorporate DOSM-specific interpretations, supporting ongoing projects like annual reports.

## Example Prompts for Statistical Analysis at DOSM 📊
Tailored for DOSM's focus on data-driven insights, assuming uploaded sources on topics like **economic indicators in post-pandemic Malaysia**.

### Prompt 1: Summarize and Compare Key Metrics
"Create a table summarizing the three uploaded reports on economic indicators. Columns: 'Source 1: [Report Title]', 'Source 2: [Report Title]', 'Source 3: [Report Title]'. Rows: 'Key GDP Metrics', 'Inflation Impacts', 'Employment Challenges'."

* **Benefit**: Highlights agreements and variances in data, aiding daily economic monitoring.

### Prompt 2: Synthesize and Identify Data Gaps
"Based on all documents, what are the primary effects of digital transformation on labor statistics? Summarize with citations, then identify undiscussed areas suggesting potential gaps for future DOSM surveys."

* **Benefit**: Performs meta-analysis to spot research needs, useful for planning statistical inquiries.

### Prompt 3: Create a Structured Outline for a Report
"Generate a detailed outline for a DOSM briefing on 'Trends in Population Demographics.' Sections: 'Introduction,' 'Key Themes' (list and define metrics), 'Contrasting Data Sources' (highlight viewpoints), 'Conclusion and Recommendations' (based on findings)."

* **Benefit**: Accelerates report drafting, ensuring comprehensive coverage grounded in sources.

This process optimizes DOSM's daily and project-based work, turning document analysis into actionable insights in minutes. For the latest features, check NotebookLM updates via Google. Efficient analyzing
