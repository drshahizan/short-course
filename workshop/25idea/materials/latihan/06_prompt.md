2. “Provide a **bullet-point summary** of the main arguments from at least 8–10 articles on **\[your topic]**. Include both strengths and weaknesses.”
3. “Write a **200-word critical summary** of current knowledge on **\[your topic]**. Highlight trends, contradictions, and research gaps.”
4. “Generate an **executive summary** for busy policymakers about **\[your topic]** in ≤150 words, focusing only on actionable insights.”
5. “Create a timeline showing how research on **\[your topic]** has developed over the past 15 years. Highlight major turning points.”
6. “Produce an annotated bibliography for 8 key works on **\[your topic]**. For each, give citation, 3-sentence summary, and critique.”
7. “Summarize literature on **\[your topic]** by methodological approach (quantitative, qualitative, mixed methods). Indicate which is most common and why.”
