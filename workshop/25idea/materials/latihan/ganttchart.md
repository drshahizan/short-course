## Gantt Chart using ChatGPT

Gantt charts, visual project management tools that illustrate tasks along a timeline using horizontal bars to represent durations, dependencies, and progress, can be efficiently created using ChatGPT by crafting structured prompts that define the project scope, list tasks with assigned time periods, and request outputs in formats like ASCII art, Markdown tables, or Python code for Matplotlib plots. This AI-assisted approach is particularly useful for professionals at organizations like the Department of Statistics Malaysia (DOSM), enabling quick generation of timelines for statistical surveys or data analysis projects without specialized software, allowing for iterative refinements such as adding overlaps, milestones, or resource allocations to enhance planning and collaboration in daily workflows.

**Step 1. Define the project scope and timeline**
Write:
*"Create a Gantt chart for a Research Work Schedule. The project duration is 12 months, starting in November 2025 and ending in October 2026."*

**Step 2. List the number of tasks**
Write:
*"There are 6 main tasks involved in this research project."*

**Step 3. Provide the task names**
Example:

* Literature Review
* Research Design
* Data Collection
* Data Analysis
* Writing Draft Report
* Final Report & Submission

**Step 4. Assign time periods for each task**
Write:
*"Distribute the tasks across the 12-month period, with some tasks overlapping logically. For example, Literature Review may start in November 2025 and end in January 2026, while Research Design runs from January to February 2026, and so on."*

**Step 5. Ask for a Gantt chart visualization**
Write:
*"Generate a Gantt chart showing tasks on the vertical axis and months (Nov 2025 – Oct 2026) on the horizontal axis. Use bars to represent task durations."*

**Step 6. Request output format**
Write:
\*"Provide the Gantt chart in two formats:

1. A visual chart (image/plot).
2. The underlying Python code using matplotlib to generate the chart, so I can edit it later."\*

✅ When combined, your **full prompt** will look like this:

**Final Prompt Example:**
*"Create a Gantt chart for a Research Work Schedule. The duration is 12 months, starting in November 2025 and ending in October 2026. There are 6 main tasks: Literature Review, Research Design, Data Collection, Data Analysis, Writing Draft Report, and Final Report & Submission. Assign each task a logical duration with possible overlaps. Generate the Gantt chart with tasks on the vertical axis and months on the horizontal axis. Provide the output as both an image and the Python code using matplotlib."*
