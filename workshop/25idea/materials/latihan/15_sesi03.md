# Document Analysis with NotebookLM

1.  **Create a New Notebook**: Go to the NotebookLM website and create a new notebook. Give it a clear, descriptive name related to your research topic. For example, "Climate Change Impacts on Agriculture" or "Review of AI in Healthcare." This helps keep your work organized.

2.  **Upload Your Sources**: Add all your research documents to the notebook. NotebookLM supports a wide variety of formats, including:
    * **PDFs**: The most common format for academic papers and reports.
    * **Google Docs & Slides**: Convenient for your personal notes and drafts.
    * **Text Files & Copied Text**: For quick excerpts or plain-text data.
    * **Web URLs**: NotebookLM can fetch and analyze the content of a web page.
    * **YouTube Videos**: It can transcribe and analyze the content of a video.
    * **Audio Files**: It can transcribe and analyze audio recordings.

    There's a limit of up to 50 sources per notebook. NotebookLM will automatically generate a summary and suggested questions for each document you upload.

3.  **Interact with Your Documents**: This is where the core analysis happens. You can interact with the AI assistant in the chat panel to ask questions and get insights based on the documents you've uploaded. The most powerful way to use this is with specific, targeted prompts.

    * **Summarization**: Ask for a summary of a single document or synthesize information from multiple sources.
        * _Prompt examples_: "What are the key arguments in this paper?", "Summarize the main findings from the three documents on marine biodiversity."

    * **Information Extraction**: Get a list of specific data points, facts, or definitions.
        * _Prompt examples_: "Extract all the statistics about renewable energy from these reports.", "What are the five most significant takeaways from this article?"

    * **Cross-Document Comparison**: Ask the AI to compare and contrast different sources to find connections, conflicts, or trends.
        * _Prompt examples_: "Compare the methodologies used in Document A and Document B.", "What are the common themes discussed across all the uploaded papers?"

4.  **Generate New Content and Organize Your Notes**: As you receive useful responses, you can save them as **Notes** in your notebook. You can also use NotebookLM to generate structured content based on your analysis.
    * **Save Important Insights**: If an AI response is particularly useful, click the "Save to Note" button to add it to your notes panel for future reference.
    * **Create Structured Documents**: Use prompts to generate things like study guides, FAQs, or briefing documents.
        * _Prompt example_: "Create a study guide based on the concepts in these lecture notes.", "Generate an FAQ for the key terms in this technical manual."

    * **Audio Overviews**: An innovative feature that can turn your sources into an AI-generated, podcast-like discussion. This is a great way to consume and understand the material if you're an auditory learner. 



### Offer Capability

Would you like me to generate some more specific and advanced prompt ideas for a particular research topic, like a literature review or a case study analysis? This could help you get even more value from your documents.
