# 📝 AI Prompt Bank

## Comprehensive AI Prompt Bank: “From Idea to Research Problem”

## 1. 🔍 Literature Discovery

*Goal: Use AI to scan, extract, and analyze knowledge about \[your topic].*

1. **Recent Studies Summary**

> “Find and summarize the **15 most recent peer-reviewed studies** on **\[your topic]**. For each, create a table with columns: Author/Year, Country/Context, Methodology, Sample, Main Findings, Limitations. At the end, synthesize the overall trends and highlight at least **3 major gaps**.”

2. **Trend Evolution**

> “Generate a timeline of how research on **\[your topic]** has evolved over the last **10 years**. Organize by period (2015–2017, 2018–2020, 2021–2023, 2024–2025). Indicate: (a) dominant methods, (b) recurring themes, (c) emerging technologies, and (d) what questions remain unanswered.”

3. **Journal Scan**

> “List the **top 5 journals** publishing on **\[your topic]**. For each journal, summarize their scope, impact factor, key trending themes, and the types of research they prioritize (quantitative, qualitative, mixed). Suggest which journal is best suited for research on **\[your topic]**.”

4. **Method Analysis**

> “From studies on **\[your topic]**, extract the methods used (e.g., surveys, experiments, simulations, case studies). Create a table with: Method → Frequency of use → Typical outcomes → Weaknesses noted by authors. Suggest **underutilized methods** that could address research gaps.”

5. **Population & Context**

> “Identify the most frequently studied **populations or contexts** in **\[your topic]** research (e.g., students, companies, regions). Highlight at least 2–3 **underrepresented populations or contexts** that future studies should target.”

6. **Variable Mapping**

> “Create a list of **independent and dependent variables** typically examined in **\[your topic]**. Organize into categories (technical, behavioral, environmental, policy-related). Indicate which variables have been studied extensively and which are **missing or overlooked**.”

7. **Theoretical Frameworks**

> “Summarize the main **theoretical frameworks or models** applied in research on **\[your topic]** (e.g., TAM, UTAUT, Diffusion of Innovation). Create a table: Theory → How applied → Strengths → Weaknesses. Suggest theories that have **not yet been tested** in this domain.”

8. **Citation Network**

> “Build a citation map of research on **\[your topic]**. Identify the most cited authors, most influential works, and clusters of research. Highlight isolated or emerging clusters that suggest **new directions**.”

9. **Systematic Review Insights**

> “Search for systematic reviews or meta-analyses on **\[your topic]**. Summarize what they conclude as: (a) established knowledge, (b) limitations of existing studies, (c) future research directions. Highlight the **top 3 research gaps** these reviews consistently mention.”

10. **Contradictions in Literature**

> “Identify **contradictions or debates** in existing research on **\[your topic]** (e.g., conflicting results, different theoretical explanations). Summarize both sides of the debate and suggest how a new study could help resolve it.”


## 2. 🌐 Visualization & Structuring

*Goal: Organize identified gaps into visual/logical frameworks.*

1. **Mind Map**

> “Create a detailed **mind map** for **\[your topic]** with four main branches: (1) Current Knowledge, (2) Identified Research Gaps, (3) Potential Research Questions, (4) Possible Objectives. Under each branch, generate 3–5 subpoints with short explanations.”

2. **Concept Map**

> “Design a **concept map** linking theories, variables, and contexts in **\[your topic]**. Show arrows for relationships (e.g., X influences Y). Label each relationship as causal, correlational, or theoretical.”

3. **Problem Tree**

> “Construct a **problem tree** for **\[your topic]**. Include: Root Causes (systemic issues), Core Problem (central challenge), and Consequences (academic, policy, community). Add 2–3 examples in each box.”

4. **SWOT Chart**

> “Develop a **SWOT analysis** for research on **\[your topic]**. Identify: Strengths (what is well-researched), Weaknesses (what is missing), Opportunities (future directions), Threats (practical or ethical barriers). Present in a 2x2 table.”

5. **Gap Categorization**

> “List research gaps in **\[your topic]** and classify them into categories: Evidence Gap, Method Gap, Context Gap, Theory Gap, Measurement Gap, Policy/Practice Gap. Provide one example study or context for each.”

6. **Research Ecosystem Map**

> “Visualize the **research ecosystem** of **\[your topic]**. Identify stakeholders (researchers, policymakers, industries, communities), relevant technologies, policies, and expected outcomes. Show their interconnections.”

7. **Idea-to-Objective Flowchart**

> “Generate a **flowchart** from Idea → Narrowed Topic → Research Gap → Problem Statement → Research Questions → Objectives for **\[your topic]**. Include a short description under each step.”

8. **Cross-Disciplinary Map**

> “Map how research from **other disciplines** (e.g., computer science, education, healthcare, engineering) intersects with **\[your topic]**. Identify opportunities for interdisciplinary approaches.”

9. **Evidence vs Novelty Chart**

> “Plot studies on **\[your topic]** on a two-axis chart: X-axis = Level of Evidence (weak to strong), Y-axis = Novelty (low to high). Highlight clusters and underexplored zones.”

10. **Hierarchical Outline**

> “Create a hierarchical outline for **\[your topic]**. Level 1: Main Theme, Level 2: Sub-themes, Level 3: Specific Issues. Ensure the outline logically flows from broad to narrow.”


## 3. 🤖 Generative AI (Reasoning & Writing)

*Goal: Draft, refine, and evaluate problem statements, research questions, and objectives.*

1. **Problem Statement Draft**

> “Write a **150–180 word problem statement** for **\[your topic]**. Structure it with: (a) background (what is known), (b) gap (what is not known), (c) significance (why it matters), (d) consequences if not addressed. Use academic tone, no exaggeration.”

2. **Aim Variations**

> “Propose 3 versions of a research **aim** for **\[your topic]**: one exploratory, one explanatory, one applied. Each should be concise and action-oriented.”

3. **Research Question Types**

> “Draft 5 possible **research questions** for **\[your topic]**. Label each as descriptive, relational, or causal. Make sure each question is feasible and aligned with the identified gap.”

4. **SMART Objectives**

> “Translate these research questions on **\[your topic]** into **SMART objectives** (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound). Present as a numbered list.”

5. **Hypotheses**

> “Formulate 3–4 **testable hypotheses** for **\[your topic]**, including expected direction (positive/negative). Mention possible confounders and how they could be controlled.”

6. **Problem Statement Critique**

> “Critically review this draft problem statement for **\[your topic]** (paste text). Point out weaknesses in clarity, logic, evidence, and alignment. Suggest a revised version.”

7. **Alignment Matrix**

> “Create an **alignment matrix** for **\[your topic]**. Columns: Research Gap → Aim → Research Question → Objective → Method → Expected Output. Highlight any inconsistencies.”

8. **Impact Projection**

> “Identify at least 3 potential **impacts** of research on **\[your topic]**: academic (knowledge contribution), policy (regulations/guidelines), community/industry (practical benefit). Write 2–3 sentences for each.”

9. **Feasibility Assessment**

> “Evaluate the **feasibility** of conducting research on **\[your topic]**. Cover: data availability, sample access, timeline, costs, and ethical considerations. Suggest practical mitigations.”

10. **Reviewer Simulation**

> “Act as a **grant reviewer**. Score a draft research proposal on **\[your topic]** on clarity, novelty, feasibility, and significance (scale 1–5). Provide strengths, weaknesses, and recommendations.”

- ✅ Ready for **direct classroom use** — copy, paste, and run with \[your topic].
- ✅ Covers the **entire pipeline**: from scanning literature → mapping gaps → drafting problem statements.
