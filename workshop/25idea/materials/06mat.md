# Practical 4: AI-Powered Literature Review & Evidence Integration in Grant Proposals

## Session Structure
This interactive workshop combines instruction, hands-on activities, and discussions to equip participants with skills to use AI for literature reviews and evidence integration effectively.

### 1. Introduction to AI for Literature Reviews and Evidence Integration (10 minutes)
- **Overview**: Explain the role of the background section in grant proposals:
  - Establishes the project‚Äôs context by summarizing existing research and identifying gaps.
  - Demonstrates the proposer‚Äôs knowledge of the field and the project‚Äôs relevance.
  - Strengthens credibility through evidence-based arguments and proper citations.
- **Role of AI**: Discuss how AI tools can assist:
  - Summarize large volumes of literature quickly (e.g., NotebookLM for research synthesis).
  - Generate draft background sections with relevant context and gaps.
  - Suggest citation formats (e.g., APA, MLA) to ensure proper attribution.
- **Ethical Considerations**:
  - AI-generated summaries must be verified for accuracy and relevance.
  - Proper citation is critical to avoid plagiarism and maintain academic integrity.
- **Example**: Demonstrate using NotebookLM to summarize a set of articles on climate change adaptation, followed by ChatGPT drafting a 200-word background section with the prompt: ‚ÄúSummarize key findings from recent literature on climate change adaptation in coastal communities and draft a 200-word background section for a grant proposal, highlighting research gaps.‚Äù

### 2. Hands-On Activity: Summarizing Literature with AI Tools (25 minutes)
- **Activity**:
  - Participants are provided with a grant scenario (e.g., a project on public health, renewable energy, or education equity) and a set of sample research articles or abstracts (provided by the instructor or sourced via AI tools with web access, if available).
  - Using AI tools (e.g., NotebookLM for synthesis, Gemini for concise summaries), participants summarize the literature with a prompt like:
    - ‚ÄúSummarize five research articles on [specific topic] in 150-200 words, highlighting key findings, trends, and research gaps relevant to a grant proposal on [topic].‚Äù
  - Participants compare outputs from different tools, evaluating clarity, depth, and relevance.
- **Guidance**:
  - Emphasize specific prompts that include the number of sources, word count, and focus (e.g., trends, gaps).
  - Teach participants to verify AI summaries against original sources to ensure accuracy and avoid misinterpretation.
- **Example Prompt**:
  - ‚ÄúUsing NotebookLM, summarize three studies on mental health interventions for adolescents, focusing on evidence-based approaches and gaps in community-based programs. Output 150 words.‚Äù

### 3. Hands-On Activity: Drafting Background Sections with AI (20 minutes)
- **Activity**:
  - Participants use AI tools to draft a background section for their grant scenario, incorporating summarized literature and identified gaps, using prompts like:
    - ‚ÄúDraft a 200-250 word background section for a grant proposal on [specific topic], synthesizing key findings from recent literature, identifying a research gap, and justifying the need for the proposed project. Use a formal tone.‚Äù
  - Example output for an education project:
    - ‚ÄúRecent studies highlight the efficacy of digital literacy programs in improving student outcomes, with a 15% increase in test scores reported (Smith et al., 2023). However, gaps remain in addressing rural schools‚Äô limited access to technology (Jones, 2024). This project addresses this gap by deploying mobile learning labs to underserved areas.‚Äù
  - Participants test tools like ChatGPT for narrative flow or Copilot for structured outputs.
- **Guidance**:
  - Instruct participants to include specific instructions in prompts (e.g., ‚Äúcite sources in APA format‚Äù or ‚Äúfocus on gaps in [specific area]‚Äù).
  - Highlight the need to refine AI outputs for coherence, alignment with grant goals, and conciseness.

### 4. Hands-On Activity: Generating Citations with AI (15 minutes)
- **Activity**:
  - Participants use AI tools to generate citations for the literature used in their background sections, using prompts like:
    - ‚ÄúGenerate APA citations for three studies on [specific topic], given the following details: [provide author names, titles, years, etc.].‚Äù
  - Example output in APA format:
    - Smith, J., & Lee, K. (2023). Digital literacy interventions in urban schools. *Journal of Education Technology, 45*(3), 123-135.
  - Participants verify AI-generated citations for accuracy using style guides (e.g., APA, MLA).
- **Guidance**:
  - Emphasize including complete source details in prompts to ensure accurate citations.
  - Teach participants to cross-check AI-generated citations against original sources or citation tools (e.g., Zotero, Mendeley).

### 5. Building a Prompt Bank for Literature Reviews and Evidence Integration (15 minutes)
- **Overview**:
  - A prompt bank provides reusable, tailored prompts for summarizing literature, drafting background sections, and generating citations, enhancing efficiency in grant writing.
- **Activity**:
  - Participants create prompts such as:
    - **Literature Summary**: ‚ÄúSummarize five studies on [topic] in 150-200 words, focusing on key findings, methodologies, and gaps relevant to a grant proposal on [topic].‚Äù
    - **Background Section**: ‚ÄúDraft a 200-word background section for a grant proposal on [topic], synthesizing recent literature, highlighting a research gap, and justifying the project‚Äôs relevance. Cite sources in APA format.‚Äù
    - **Citations**: ‚ÄúGenerate APA citations for three studies on [topic], using the following details: [provide source information].‚Äù
  - Participants share prompts for peer feedback and compile them into a shared bank.
- **Example Additional Prompt**:
  - ‚ÄúUsing ChatGPT, draft a 250-word background section for a grant proposal on [topic], integrating findings from three studies, identifying a gap, and aligning with [funding agency‚Äôs mission].‚Äù

### 6. Discussion and Reflection (10 minutes)
- **Group Discussion**:
  - Participants share experiences with AI tools, discussing strengths (e.g., NotebookLM‚Äôs synthesis capabilities, Copilot‚Äôs structured outputs) and challenges (e.g., inaccurate summaries or citation errors).
  - Explore strategies for improving prompt specificity and verifying AI outputs.
- **Ethical Considerations**:
  - Stress the importance of verifying AI-generated summaries and citations to avoid errors or plagiarism.
  - Encourage participants to use AI as a tool to assist, not replace, their research efforts, ensuring proper attribution and alignment with the proposer‚Äôs voice.

## Learning Outcomes
By the end of this practical, participants will:
1. Be proficient in using AI tools to summarize literature and draft evidence-based background sections for grant proposals.
2. Develop skills to generate accurate citations using AI, ensuring compliance with academic standards.
3. Create a reusable prompt bank for literature reviews, background sections, and citations, streamlining future grant writing.
4. Understand ethical practices for integrating AI-generated content, including fact-checking and proper attribution.

## Additional Recommendations
- **Tools Access**: Ensure participants can access AI tools (e.g., free versions of ChatGPT, Gemini, or NotebookLM) and sample research articles during the session.
- **Resources**: Provide a style guide (e.g., APA, MLA) and a starter prompt bank to support activities.
- **Follow-Up**: Assign participants to draft a full background section with citations using AI and submit it for feedback, ensuring alignment with a specific grant scenario.
