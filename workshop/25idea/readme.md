## **Synopsis**

The workshop **‚ÄúFrom Idea to Impact: Writing Winning Grant Proposals with Generative AI‚Äù** is a full-day training program designed to equip researchers, academics, and postgraduate students with the skills to craft compelling and competitive grant proposals. By leveraging the power of Generative AI, participants will learn practical strategies to transform innovative ideas into well-structured, high-impact proposals that align with funding requirements.

This interactive session will cover essential techniques in proposal writing, including problem framing, articulating research significance, and demonstrating innovation. Participants will also explore how AI tools can support the drafting, refining, and strengthening of grant applications, ensuring higher chances of success in a competitive funding landscape.

The workshop will be conducted by **Assoc. Prof. Dr. Ts. Mohd Shahizan Othman**, Faculty of Computing, Universiti Teknologi Malaysia, who brings extensive expertise in research, data-driven innovation, and academic capacity building. Organized by the **Faculty of Management (FM) ResearchXcelerator**, this program reflects UTM‚Äôs commitment to empowering scholars with advanced tools and methodologies to drive impactful research outcomes.

## **Workshop Learning Outcomes**

By the end of this workshop, participants will be able to:

1. **Identify the key components of a successful grant proposal** and understand the expectations of funding agencies.
2. **Leverage Generative AI tools** to draft, refine, and enhance the clarity and persuasiveness of research proposals.
3. **Formulate strong research objectives and impact statements** that align with national and international funding priorities.
4. **Develop compelling and evidence-based narratives** that highlight innovation, feasibility, and significance.
5. **Apply best practices and AI-assisted strategies** to increase the competitiveness and success rate of grant applications.

## [Workshop Schedule](materials/time.md)

This section presents the **detailed agenda** of the workshop, mapping out the sequence of sessions, interactive activities, and breaks. It guides participants through a **step-by-step journey** that begins with understanding grant policies and funding landscapes, continues with exploring the role of Generative AI in proposal writing, and progresses to hands-on practice in developing, refining, and strengthening proposals. The schedule ensures a **balanced integration of theory, AI tool demonstrations, and practical application** that culminates in drafting high-impact proposals.

## [Teaching Materials](materials/teaching.md)

This section provides the **core resources and references** essential for mastering grant proposal writing with Generative AI. It includes funding agency guidelines, examples of successful proposals, global reports on AI in research management, as well as technical guides for setting up and using AI platforms. Supplementary resources such as curated videos and case studies help participants connect **theoretical knowledge with practical application**, ensuring they leave with both conceptual understanding and actionable skills.

## [AI Tools for Research Workflow](materials/ai.md)

This section introduces participants to a carefully selected set of **Generative AI tools tailored to the grant proposal process**. Tools are showcased according to their role in the research workflow, such as idea generation, structuring problem statements, enhancing clarity of objectives, improving narrative flow, and refining final drafts. Each tool is presented with its **unique features, ethical considerations, and real-world examples** to help participants adopt AI responsibly and effectively. By mastering these tools, participants gain a competitive edge in producing compelling, fundable proposals.
