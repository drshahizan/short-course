 <img src="https://github.com/drshahizan/short-course/blob/main/workshop/25idea/images/idea.jpeg" alt="Shahizan SLR"  height="400">


## **Synopsis**

The workshop **‚ÄúFrom Idea to Impact: Writing Winning Grant Proposals with Generative AI‚Äù** is a full-day training program designed to equip researchers, academics, and postgraduate students with the skills to craft compelling and competitive grant proposals. By leveraging the power of Generative AI, participants will learn practical strategies to transform innovative ideas into well-structured, high-impact proposals that align with funding requirements.

This interactive session will cover essential techniques in proposal writing, including problem framing, articulating research significance, and demonstrating innovation. Participants will also explore how AI tools can support the drafting, refining, and strengthening of grant applications, ensuring higher chances of success in a competitive funding landscape.

The workshop will be conducted by **Assoc. Prof. Dr. Ts. Mohd Shahizan Othman**, Faculty of Computing, Universiti Teknologi Malaysia, who brings extensive expertise in research, data-driven innovation, and academic capacity building. Organized by the **Faculty of Management (FM) ResearchXcelerator**, this program reflects UTM‚Äôs commitment to empowering scholars with advanced tools and methodologies to drive impactful research outcomes.

## **Workshop Learning Outcomes**

By the end of the workshop, participants will be able to:

1. **Understand Publishing Requirements**

   * Identify the key standards and expectations of ERA and Scopus-indexed journals.
   * Recognize common reasons for manuscript rejection and strategies to overcome them.

2. **Apply Generative AI Tools in Academic Writing**

   * Utilize AI-powered platforms to improve clarity, coherence, and academic style in draft articles.
   * Enhance argumentation, literature integration, and citation management with the support of AI.

3. **Improve Draft Manuscripts**

   * Refine participants‚Äô own draft papers through hands-on AI-assisted editing.
   * Strengthen structure, flow, and overall readability to meet international publishing standards.

4. **Evaluate Ethical and Responsible Use of AI**

   * Discuss ethical considerations and limitations of using Generative AI in scholarly writing.
   * Apply best practices to ensure academic integrity while integrating AI in manuscript preparation.

5. **Develop Practical Publishing Strategies**

   * Formulate a plan to prepare and finalize manuscripts for submission to reputable journals.
   * Gain confidence in aligning research contributions with target journal scopes and impact.

## [Workshop Schedule](materials/time.md)

This section provides the **complete timetable** for the workshop, outlining the sequence of sessions, activities, and breaks. It helps participants know what to expect, when practical sessions will take place, and how theory and hands-on learning are balanced throughout the day. The schedule ensures a **structured flow** from policy awareness, to AI tools exploration, to practical manuscript refinement.

## [Teaching materials](materials/teaching.md)

This section contains the **essential learning resources and references** used during the workshop. It includes official guidelines (UNESCO, national, and institutional), global AI adoption reports, practical setup instructions, and curated videos. Together, these materials provide participants with **theoretical background, best practices, and practical guides** to reinforce what they learn during the workshop and to support continued application afterward.

## [AI Tools for Research Workflow](materials/ai.md)

This section introduces participants to a curated set of **AI tools designed to support researchers across the entire research lifecycle**. From literature discovery and idea generation to data visualization and academic writing, each tool is presented with its **purpose, strengths, and practical use cases**. This equips participants with the digital skills to adopt AI ethically and effectively in their own research and teaching.
