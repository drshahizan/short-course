 <img src="https://github.com/drshahizan/short-course/blob/main/workshop/25idea/images/idea.jpeg" alt="Shahizan SLR"  height="400">


## **Synopsis**

The **WriteWise+: Enhancing Articles for ERA/Scopus with Generative AI** workshop is designed to empower researchers, academics, and postgraduate students with advanced strategies for improving the quality and impact of their scholarly articles. In today‚Äôs competitive research environment, achieving publication in reputable indexing platforms such as **ERA and Scopus** requires more than strong ideas‚Äîit demands clear structure, academic rigor, and adherence to international publishing standards.

This one-day hands-on workshop introduces participants to the practical use of **Generative AI tools** to refine their manuscripts. By leveraging AI-powered writing assistants, attendees will learn how to enhance clarity, coherence, and scholarly tone, as well as strengthen argumentation and citation management. The session will also cover ethical considerations in AI-assisted academic writing, ensuring participants can integrate these tools responsibly.

Led by **Assoc. Prof. Dr. Ts. Mohd Shahizan Othman** from the Faculty of Computing, Universiti Teknologi Malaysia, the workshop emphasizes **interactive learning**. Participants are encouraged to bring along their draft papers to gain personalized feedback and direct improvements during the session.

By the end of the workshop, attendees will be equipped with practical skills and actionable techniques to transform their manuscripts into publishable-quality articles ready for submission to ERA/Scopus-indexed journals.


## **Workshop Learning Outcomes**

By the end of the workshop, participants will be able to:

1. **Understand Publishing Requirements**

   * Identify the key standards and expectations of ERA and Scopus-indexed journals.
   * Recognize common reasons for manuscript rejection and strategies to overcome them.

2. **Apply Generative AI Tools in Academic Writing**

   * Utilize AI-powered platforms to improve clarity, coherence, and academic style in draft articles.
   * Enhance argumentation, literature integration, and citation management with the support of AI.

3. **Improve Draft Manuscripts**

   * Refine participants‚Äô own draft papers through hands-on AI-assisted editing.
   * Strengthen structure, flow, and overall readability to meet international publishing standards.

4. **Evaluate Ethical and Responsible Use of AI**

   * Discuss ethical considerations and limitations of using Generative AI in scholarly writing.
   * Apply best practices to ensure academic integrity while integrating AI in manuscript preparation.

5. **Develop Practical Publishing Strategies**

   * Formulate a plan to prepare and finalize manuscripts for submission to reputable journals.
   * Gain confidence in aligning research contributions with target journal scopes and impact.

## [Workshop Schedule](materials/time.md)

This section provides the **complete timetable** for the workshop, outlining the sequence of sessions, activities, and breaks.
