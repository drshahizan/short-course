#  🟩 **Session 1: Welcome & Introduction to ChatGPT**

This session is designed to help Korean high school students **warm up**, **feel comfortable using English**, and **get introduced to ChatGPT** in an easy and engaging way. The tone should be friendly and supportive, with visual aids and live demonstrations to maintain interest.

## ✅ **1. Ice-Breaking Activity: Introduce Yourself with ChatGPT's Help**

**Objective:** Make students less shy and introduce basic ChatGPT prompting.

* The instructor greets everyone and briefly introduces the workshop.

* Each student will work in pairs or small groups with a device (or guided by the instructor on a projector) to type a simple prompt like:

  > ✍️ *"Help me introduce myself in English. I am 16 years old. I like music and drawing."*

* ChatGPT returns a sentence like:

  > *"Hi! My name is Jisoo. I am 16 years old and I enjoy music and drawing. Nice to meet you!"*

* Students then read aloud their generated introductions (voluntarily or in small groups).

> 💡 *Benefit:* Eases nervousness, shows how ChatGPT can support them immediately.



## ✅ **2. What is ChatGPT? How Does It Work?**

**Objective:** Explain the basic idea of ChatGPT in simple, age-appropriate English.

* Explain that **ChatGPT is a computer program made by OpenAI** that can read and write like a human.
* Use visuals or analogies:

  * ChatGPT is like a **very smart robot friend** who has read millions of books and websites.
  * It doesn’t “think” like a person, but it gives answers based on patterns in data.
* Key points:

  * It responds to **“prompts”** (questions or instructions).
  * It uses **machine learning**, especially **language models**.

> 👀 *Visual demo:* Show how ChatGPT answers a few example questions live.


## ✅ **3. Why English is Important in AI and the Global World**

**Objective:** Motivate students to see the value of learning English in today’s AI-driven, globalized world.

* Explain that English is the **international language** of:

  * Technology (AI tools, programming)
  * Science and academic writing
  * Business and job markets
* Most AI tools—including ChatGPT—**use English by default**, and understanding English makes them more powerful for learning.

> 🌍 *Mini discussion:* Ask students, “Where do you see English in your life?” (e.g., YouTube, games, K-pop interviews, school subjects)

## ✅ **4. Simple Examples: Asking Questions in English Using ChatGPT**

**Objective:** Let students try real, simple English prompts and see friendly responses.

Provide 3–5 prompts they can try immediately:

* 🗣️ *“Teach me 5 English words about food.”*
* 🗣️ *“What is the meaning of ‘curious’?”*
* 🗣️ *“Make a sentence using the word ‘challenge’.”*
* 🗣️ *“Help me write a thank you message to my teacher.”*

Instructor demonstrates each example on screen and explains what’s happening.

> ✏️ *Activity:* Each student types one question in English into ChatGPT and reads the response with a partner or aloud.

### 🎯 **Session Goal Recap**

> 🧠 *By the end of this session, students should:*

* Understand what ChatGPT is and what it can do.
* Feel **safe and confident** asking questions in English.
* See that AI can help them improve their **real-life English** skills.
* Start the day with **energy, curiosity, and low anxiety**.
