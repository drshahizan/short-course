# [ChatGPT: ScholarGPT Mode](https://chatgpt.com/gpts)

 <img src="https://gpt.kiwi/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Scholar-GPT.png" alt="Dr Shahizan AI tools"  height="400">

**ChatGPT (ScholarGPT mode)** is a specialized configuration of OpenAI‚Äôs ChatGPT tailored for academic writing, research support, and scholarly communication. It is designed to help students, researchers, and faculty members write, review, and refine academic content with clarity and rigor. It supports both surface-level productivity (writing assistance) and deep analytical tasks (research reasoning, synthesis, and refinement).

## üéì Role of ScholarGPT in Writing & Deep Research Assistance

### 1. **Academic Writing Support**
- Helps in drafting key academic components:
  - Abstracts
  - Introductions
  - Literature reviews
  - Methodology sections
  - Research discussions and conclusions
- Supports **APA, MLA, Chicago, and IEEE** formatting styles.
- Example:
  > ‚ÄúWrite an abstract for a paper on the impact of AI on personalized education.‚Äù

### 2. **Proofreading and Academic Tone Refinement**
- Refines grammar, logic, and fluency while adjusting tone for academic clarity and formality.
- Helps improve transitions, coherence, and technical phrasing.
- Example:
  > ‚ÄúImprove this paragraph to sound more suitable for a Scopus Q1 journal.‚Äù

### 3. **Critical Literature Analysis**
- Provides synthesis across multiple studies and identifies theoretical gaps.
- Can summarize and compare findings from different research works.
- Example:
  > ‚ÄúSummarize and compare findings from three studies on sustainable supply chains.‚Äù

### 4. **Research Design Reasoning**
- Suggests data collection strategies, theoretical models, and variable relationships.
- Offers guidance on selecting suitable methodology (quantitative, qualitative, or mixed-methods).
- Example:
  > ‚ÄúWhat methodology should I use to study ethical AI adoption in SMEs?‚Äù

### 5. **Response to Reviewer Comments**
- Assists in drafting professional and concise responses to peer reviewer feedback.
- Can also help revise content based on reviewer suggestions.
- Example:
  > ‚ÄúWrite a polite response to a reviewer asking for more theoretical justification.‚Äù

### 6. **Systematic Literature Review (SLR) Support**
- Helps in defining inclusion/exclusion criteria, search strings, and SLR protocol.
- Assists in synthesizing and categorizing findings into themes.
- Example:
  > ‚ÄúHelp me organize a PRISMA-based review of AI use in public administration.‚Äù

## ‚öôÔ∏è Why Use ScholarGPT for This Stage?

| Task                              | ScholarGPT Advantage                                                     |
|-----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|

| Language Refinement               | Improves fluency, clarity, coherence, and academic vocabulary            |
| Deep Research Thinking            | Supports literature synthesis, gap identification, and theoretical framing|
| Research Design                   | Suggests frameworks, hypotheses, and appropriate methodologies           |
| Academic Publishing Assistance    | Helps prepare responses, reformatting, and manuscript refinement         |

## üöÄ Strengths for Researchers

- **Academic Language Proficiency**: Trained on scholarly data and examples for domain-appropriate tone.
- **Rapid Drafting**: Speeds up initial writing and revision processes.
- **Thematic Structuring**: Helps categorize arguments and findings into cohesive outlines or summaries.
- **Adaptive Guidance**: Allows back-and-forth refinement through conversational iterations.

## üìå Limitations to Consider

- **No Access to Paywalled Sources**: Does not retrieve full-text journal articles unless provided by the user.
- **Citation Insertion is Manual**: May suggest sources or ideas, but users must verify and insert proper citations.
- **Content Validation Required**: AI suggestions should be cross-checked for factual and theoretical accuracy.

## ‚úÖ Example Prompt Ideas

```text
1. "Draft a literature review on gamification in higher education, focused on motivation theories."
2. "Paraphrase this methodology section to meet journal submission standards."
3. "Suggest 3 hypotheses and a conceptual model for a study on fintech adoption in Malaysia."
4. "Help me structure a response to a reviewer asking for more statistical explanation."
5. "Compare grounded theory and thematic analysis for qualitative research on user behavior."
