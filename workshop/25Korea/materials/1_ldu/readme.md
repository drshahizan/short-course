# 1. Literature Discovery & Understanding

## 🔸 Purpose
To search, filter, and understand the most relevant scholarly work efficiently. This phase forms the foundation for defining your research gap and framing research questions.

## 💡 Why Use AI in This Step?
AI helps overcome time-consuming, keyword-limited searches by understanding meaning, suggesting connections, and summarizing dense papers. It allows researchers to discover relevant insights faster and more comprehensively.

## AI Tools

* **🧠 [Zeta Alpha](./ai/zeta.md)** –
An AI-powered semantic search engine designed for academic research. Unlike traditional keyword-based search, Zeta Alpha understands the meaning behind your query and returns conceptually relevant papers. It also helps users track research trends and follow topic-specific updates using natural language search capabilities.

* **📚 [Scopus AI](./ai/scopus.md)** – A new feature within the Scopus platform that uses generative AI to summarize research areas, suggest related documents, and answer specific queries based on a curated database of peer-reviewed literature. It helps in quickly understanding complex research landscapes and identifying seminal works.

* **🧾 [SciSpace](./ai/scispace.md/)** – Formerly known as Typeset, SciSpace uses AI to explain and summarize research papers in plain language. It offers features like citation tracing (to find connected studies), Q\&A-style document interactions, and GPT-powered explanations for math, code, and scientific concepts within PDFs.

## Others
