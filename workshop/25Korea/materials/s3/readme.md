# üü® **Session 3: Everyday English with ChatGPT**

In this session, we explore how **ChatGPT** can support your development of **practical, everyday English skills** ‚Äî particularly useful for daily communication in academic, professional, and social contexts. The focus is on how to interact with ChatGPT to **enhance your politeness, grammar, vocabulary**, and **autonomous learning habits** in English.

### üü° **1. Making Polite Requests and Greetings**

#### ‚ú¶ Why It Matters:

In both academic and international environments, polite and appropriate language use is essential ‚Äî especially in emails, presentations, classroom discussions, and social interactions. First impressions are often shaped by how we speak or write.

#### ‚ú¶ How ChatGPT Helps:

* ChatGPT can **model common English greetings** used in formal and informal contexts (e.g., emails to lecturers vs. chatting with peers).
* It can teach you how to **structure polite requests**, such as asking for assistance or clarification (e.g., ‚ÄúWould you mind helping me with‚Ä¶‚Äù vs. ‚ÄúHelp me with‚Ä¶‚Äù).
* It helps you recognize **tone and register**, key concepts in effective communication.

#### ‚ú¶ Learning Strategy:

Ask ChatGPT to rephrase direct or informal requests into polite, professional ones. Then, reflect on the differences in tone and structure.

### üü° **2. ChatGPT as Your English Study Partner**

#### ‚ú¶ Why It Matters:

Effective language learning requires **consistent practice** and immediate feedback ‚Äî both of which are often unavailable in traditional classroom settings. ChatGPT offers you a **low-pressure, always-available environment** to practice English at your own pace.

#### ‚ú¶ How ChatGPT Helps:

* Acts as a **conversational partner**, allowing you to simulate real-world dialogues.
* Supports your **self-directed learning** by providing vocabulary lists, practice questions, and follow-up explanations.
* Reinforces your **academic independence**, a core skill at the university level.

#### ‚ú¶ Learning Strategy:

Use ChatGPT to simulate a conversation about your field of study, daily routine, or global issues. Record or save the exchange to review vocabulary and sentence structures later.

### üü° **3. Correcting Grammar and Pronunciation Tips**

#### ‚ú¶ Why It Matters:

Academic and professional writing requires **grammatical accuracy and clarity**. While ChatGPT cannot hear you speak, it can provide you with guidance on **grammar structures, sentence formation**, and even **pronunciation cues** using phonetics.

#### ‚ú¶ How ChatGPT Helps:

* Provides **corrections and explanations** when you paste a sentence or paragraph.
* Can identify **common grammatical errors**, such as verb tense, subject-verb agreement, prepositions, or article usage.
* Offers **pronunciation tips** using International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) or plain descriptions (e.g., ‚Äúschedule‚Äù as /Ààsk…õd í.uÀêl/ or ‚Äúskejool‚Äù).

#### ‚ú¶ Learning Strategy:

Write a short paragraph about a current topic (e.g., your recent assignment) and ask ChatGPT to check grammar and explain any corrections it makes.

### üü° **4. Using ChatGPT for Vocabulary Learning and Sentence Building**

#### ‚ú¶ Why It Matters:

Vocabulary is the foundation of fluent expression. However, **knowing a word** is not enough ‚Äî you must know how to **use it correctly in context**. Sentence building also develops your ability to explain, compare, persuade, and narrate.

#### ‚ú¶ How ChatGPT Helps:

* Offers **clear definitions, synonyms, antonyms**, and **collocations** (common word pairings).
* Generates **example sentences** across different contexts (academic, casual, formal).
* Helps you identify **correct word forms** (noun, verb, adjective, adverb) and how to use them in complex sentences.

#### ‚ú¶ Learning Strategy:

Choose five unfamiliar words from your reading material. Ask ChatGPT to define them, provide collocations, and use each word in both an academic and informal sentence.

### ‚úÖ **Learning Outcomes:**

By the end of this session, you should be able to:

* Apply polite English in everyday and academic settings using models generated by ChatGPT.
* Independently engage in English conversation and writing with support from ChatGPT.
* Recognize and correct common grammatical errors in your own writing.
* Expand and apply your vocabulary appropriately through AI-assisted practice.
