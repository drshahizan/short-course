# Research Gap

 <img src="https://github.com/drshahizan/short-course/blob/main/25upsi/images/research%20gap.jpeg" alt="Image Alt Text"  height="800">

The diagram illustrates the concept of a **Research Gap** by Kumar DM (2020). It highlights the process of identifying gaps in knowledge from existing research (known) and uncovering areas where further investigation is needed (unknown). Below is a detailed explanation of the components of the diagram:

### **Key Components:**

1. **Research Gap**:
   - A research gap exists when there is a lack of sufficient or accurate information in a particular area of study. It represents the **weaknesses of past findings** or the lack of certain data that researchers can explore.

2. **Past Knowledge (Known)**:
   - This includes what is already documented and established in existing literature. It comprises:
     - **Gap in Population**: Certain populations or demographics might be underrepresented in research.
     - **Gap in Analysis**: Inadequate analytical methods or overlooked dimensions in data analysis.
     - **Gap in Implication**: Limited application or impact of findings on real-world issues.
     - **Gap in Methods**: Insufficient or outdated methodologies used in studies.

3. **Expected Knowledge (Unknown)**:
   - Represents areas requiring further study, opening opportunities for researchers. These include:
     - **Gap in Concepts**: Missing or unclear concepts in the subject area.
     - **Gap in Perspectives**: Absence of diverse viewpoints in existing research.
     - **Gap in Theory**: Lack of a cohesive theoretical framework to explain phenomena.
     - **Gap in Methodology**: Missing innovative or advanced methodological approaches.

4. **Central Dynamics**:
   - Research gaps often occur due to **inconsistencies, controversies, conflicts, and contradictions** between known and unknown knowledge.

5. **Outcome**:
   - By addressing these gaps, researchers can create:
     - **A Conceptual Frame** (based on known knowledge).
     - **A New Theoretical Frame** (derived from addressing unknown gaps).

### **Example of a Research Gap in Computer Science**:

**Topic**: **"Optimizing AI Algorithms for Low-Resource Devices in Edge Computing"**

#### **Identified Research Gaps**:
1. **Gap in Population**:
   - Most studies optimize AI models for high-end devices but neglect low-resource devices prevalent in developing regions.

2. **Gap in Methods**:
   - Current optimization methods focus on improving accuracy, but they ignore energy consumption and computational constraints.

3. **Gap in Theory**:
   - Lack of a theoretical framework explaining the trade-offs between AI model performance, energy efficiency, and latency in edge devices.

4. **Gap in Perspectives**:
   - Limited perspectives on integrating local cultural and ethical considerations in AI deployment for diverse geographic regions.

5. **Gap in Concepts**:
   - Undefined concepts around lightweight neural networks tailored for edge computing in smart homes.

#### **Research Question**:
- How can AI models be optimized for edge computing environments to ensure energy efficiency and performance without compromising user experience?
