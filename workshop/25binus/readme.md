# The Integration of AI Tools in Postgraduate Computer Science Studies

## Workshop Synopsis

The **‚ÄúAI Tools for Research‚Äù** workshop is designed to equip postgraduate students, faculty members, and researchers with practical knowledge and hands-on exposure to cutting-edge artificial intelligence (AI) tools that can enhance academic productivity and innovation.

In today‚Äôs research landscape, AI applications are increasingly used to accelerate literature reviews, improve data analysis, support writing and editing, and generate impactful visualizations. This workshop introduces participants to a range of AI-powered platforms and demonstrates how they can be effectively applied at different stages of the research process‚Äîfrom idea generation and proposal development to data interpretation and scholarly publication.

Led by **Assoc. Prof. Ts. Dr. Mohd Shahizan bin Othman** from the Faculty of Computing, Universiti Teknologi Malaysia (UTM), the session will highlight real-world use cases, best practices, and ethical considerations when adopting AI tools in academia. Participants will also gain insights into strategies for optimizing research workflows, enhancing collaboration, and ensuring academic integrity in the age of generative AI.

By the end of the workshop, participants will:

1. Understand the capabilities and limitations of various AI tools for research.
2. Explore practical applications of AI in literature review, writing, data analysis, and visualization.
3. Develop strategies to integrate AI tools effectively and responsibly into their research practices.

The session will be moderated by **Mohd Shahaeil Bin Nordin**, Vice President I of PGSS FM. Participants will also receive ACAD points and an official E-certificate upon completion.

## **Workshop Learning Outcomes**

By the end of the workshop, research students will be able to:
1. **Utilize** AI tools to streamline literature reviews, academic writing, and data management.
2. **Apply** AI-powered techniques for data analysis and visualization to strengthen research findings.
3. **Adopt** responsible and ethical practices in integrating AI into their research workflow.

## [Workshop Program Structure](materials/time.md)

The **Workshop Program Structure** is designed to guide research students through a progressive learning pathway that balances theory, applied practice, reflection, and ethical considerations. It begins with an overview of publishing essentials to build foundational knowledge, followed by a series of applied research writing sessions where participants actively refine their manuscripts using AI tools for language enhancement, structural improvement, and literature management. The structure also incorporates feedback and sharing opportunities to encourage peer learning and self-reflection. The program concludes with a dedicated session on ethical AI use and a clear roadmap to ERA/Scopus submission, ensuring participants not only gain practical skills but also uphold academic integrity throughout their research journey.

## [AI Tools for Research Workflow](materials/ai.md)

This section introduces participants to a curated set of **AI tools designed to support researchers across the entire research lifecycle**. From literature discovery and idea generation to data visualization and academic writing, each tool is presented with its **purpose, strengths, and practical use cases**. This equips participants with the digital skills to adopt AI ethically and effectively in their own research and teaching.
