# Exercise 3: Step-by-Step Workshop Exercises for SLR in Computer Science

## **🔹 Step 1: Identifying a Research Gap in Computer Science**  
**Objective:** Develop a well-defined research question by identifying gaps in existing studies.  

### **📝 Instructions:**  
1️⃣ **Choose a research topic** in **computer science** from the list below or propose your own:  
   - Machine Learning in Cybersecurity  
   - AI Ethics and Bias in Decision-Making  
   - Blockchain Applications in Healthcare  
   - IoT Security Challenges  
   - Cloud Computing Performance Optimization  
   - Quantum Computing in Cryptography  

2️⃣ **Search for recent papers (last 5 years)** in databases like:  
   - Google Scholar  
   - IEEE Xplore  
   - ACM Digital Library  
   - Scopus  

3️⃣ **Read the abstract and conclusion** of at least **5 papers** and identify what research has been done.  

4️⃣ **Identify the research gap** by asking:  
   - What problem is **not fully solved**?  
   - What limitations do existing studies mention?  
   - What aspects are **underexplored**?  

5️⃣ **Formulate a research question** using the **PICOC framework**:  
   - **P**opulation (Who/What is studied?)  
   - **I**ntervention (What technology/method is used?)  
   - **C**omparison (Compared to what?)  
   - **O**utcome (What result is expected?)  
   - **C**ontext (What environment is it applied in?)  

### **🔹 Expected Output:**  
- A **structured research question**.  
- A **short summary (100-200 words)** explaining the research gap.  

## **🔹 Step 2: Constructing a Search Strategy for Literature Retrieval**  
**Objective:** Develop a systematic search strategy using Boolean operators.  

### **📝 Instructions:**  
1️⃣ **Based on your research question from Step 1**, list **keywords and synonyms**.  
   - Example:  
     - **Topic**: Deep Learning in Cybersecurity  
     - **Keywords**: "Deep Learning," "Neural Networks," "Cybersecurity," "Threat Detection"  

2️⃣ **Construct a search query using Boolean operators**:  
   - `("Deep Learning" OR "Neural Networks") AND ("Cybersecurity" OR "Intrusion Detection") AND ("Threat Analysis") NOT ("Social Media")`  

3️⃣ **Search on academic databases**:  
   - Google Scholar, IEEE Xplore, ACM Digital Library, Scopus.  

4️⃣ **Use database filters**:  
   - **Year filter**: Last 5 years.  
   - **Document type**: Journal/conference papers.  
   - **Keywords filter**: Focused on your topic.  

5️⃣ **Record the number of results found** and refine the query if necessary.  

### **🔹 Expected Output:**  
- A **well-structured search query**.  
- A **screenshot or list of the top 5 relevant papers**.  

## **🔹 Step 3: Evaluating and Managing Literature Using a Reference Management Tool**  
**Objective:** Use Zotero, Mendeley, or EndNote to manage references.  

### **📝 Instructions:**  
1️⃣ **Choose a reference manager**: Zotero, Mendeley, or EndNote.  

2️⃣ **Import at least 5 selected research papers** into the tool.  

3️⃣ **Organize papers into folders/tags**:  
   - Example: “Security,” “Machine Learning,” “Blockchain.”  

4️⃣ **Add annotations or notes**:  
   - Summarize key findings in each paper.  

5️⃣ **Generate a bibliography in IEEE format.**  

### **🔹 Expected Output:**  
- A **well-organized reference list**.  
- **Short notes for each paper** summarizing key insights.  

## **🔹 Step 4: Critical Appraisal of Selected Research Papers**  
**Objective:** Assess the quality of research papers using a critical appraisal checklist.  

### **📝 Instructions:**  
1️⃣ **Select two key papers** from Step 3.  

2️⃣ **Use the CASP (Critical Appraisal Skills Programme) checklist**:  
   - **Is the research question clearly defined?**  
   - **Are the methods valid and reliable?**  
   - **Are the results applicable to real-world scenarios?**  
   - **Are there any biases in the study?**  

3️⃣ **Evaluate each paper** based on these questions.  

4️⃣ **Document strengths and weaknesses** of each study.  

### **🔹 Expected Output:**  
- A **critical appraisal table** summarizing the quality of each study.  
- A **reflection (100-200 words)** on the reliability of the studies reviewed.  

## **🔹 Step 5: Writing an Annotated Bibliography for SLR**  
**Objective:** Develop a structured summary of selected papers.  

### **📝 Instructions:**  
1️⃣ **Select three key papers** from Step 3.  

2️⃣ **Write an annotated bibliography** summarizing:  
   - The main **objective** of the study.  
   - The **methodology** used.  
   - **Key findings**.  
   - **Relevance** to your research question.  

3️⃣ **Compare the studies** and highlight:  
   - **Trends** in research.  
   - **Gaps or inconsistencies**.  

### **🔹 Expected Output:**  
- A **structured annotated bibliography (3 short paragraphs).**  
- Identification of **patterns and gaps** in the literature.  

## **🔹 Bonus: Group Discussion – Constructing an SLR Protocol**  
**Objective:** Develop a structured **SLR protocol** as a team.  

### **📝 Instructions:**  
1️⃣ **Form groups of 3-5 participants**.  

2️⃣ **Each group selects a research topic** from Step 1.  

3️⃣ **Develop a basic SLR protocol** covering:  
   - **Research questions**.  
   - **Search strategy**.  
   - **Inclusion/exclusion criteria**.  
   - **Quality assessment method**.  

4️⃣ **Present findings** to the class for discussion.  

### **Final Notes**
🔹 These exercises **simulate real-world research tasks** in computer science.  
🔹 Participants will gain **practical experience** in each step of conducting an SLR.  
🔹 By the end of the workshop, they will have a **strong foundation** in systematic research methods.
