# 📝 **Exercise: Practical 3 – Improving Structure & Coherence**

**Focus: Reorganizing paragraphs, refining argument flow, and strengthening contribution using AI support.**

## 🎯 **Objective**

To help participants **restructure their draft paragraphs or sections** so that ideas flow logically, arguments are stronger, and contributions are clearer. Students will learn how to use AI tools to improve **organization, transitions, and coherence**.

## 📋 **Step 1: Select a Section**

Choose **one section** of your draft (Introduction, Literature Review, or Discussion). Select the part where:

* Sentences feel **disconnected or jumpy**.
* The **main argument is buried** under details.
* The **contribution is not clear** to the reader.

## 🤖 **Step 2: Apply AI with Suitable Prompts**

| **Goal**                       | **Prompts (Copy & Use)** |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 🏗️ **Reorganize Paragraphs**  | 1. Restructure this section so that the main argument appears first and supporting evidence follows.<br>2. Rearrange this text into a logical order: background → problem → solution → contribution.<br>3. Rewrite this passage to put the strongest points at the beginning.<br>4. Organize this content so that general ideas come first and details follow.<br>5. Reorder sentences to ensure the topic sentence introduces the key point.<br>6. Rewrite so that the problem is presented first, then the evidence, then the conclusion.<br>7. Restructure this section to highlight the research gap clearly before presenting findings.<br>8. Reorganize the sequence so arguments build naturally toward the conclusion.<br>9. Rewrite this section so that supporting evidence comes after the claim, not before.<br>10. Reorder ideas for clarity: context → issue → justification → findings. |
| 🔗 **Improve Transitions**     | 1. Rewrite this passage to ensure smooth transitions between sentences and paragraphs.<br>2. Add appropriate linking words and phrases to make the flow more coherent.<br>3. Improve sentence-to-sentence transitions so the logic is easier to follow.<br>4. Rewrite to add connectors such as “however,” “therefore,” and “in contrast” where appropriate.<br>5. Edit this passage to improve logical linking between paragraphs.<br>6. Add transitional sentences to connect separate ideas smoothly.<br>7. Rewrite this section to reduce abrupt jumps between ideas.<br>8. Insert signposting phrases to guide the reader through the argument.<br>9. Improve flow by ensuring each sentence connects back to the central theme.<br>10. Rewrite with improved transitions so the narrative reads seamlessly.                                                                                      |
| 🎯 **Highlight Contribution**  | 1. Restructure this paragraph to make the research contribution explicit and easy to identify.<br>2. Rewrite this section so that the novelty of the study is emphasized at the end of the argument.<br>3. Highlight the unique contribution of this work compared to prior studies.<br>4. Emphasize the new methodology, framework, or dataset introduced in this study.<br>5. Rewrite this to make the research significance more visible.<br>6. Summarize the main contribution of the study in one clear sentence.<br>7. Restructure to stress why this work matters for the academic community.<br>8. Rewrite so the research gap and how this study fills it are clear.<br>9. Highlight the practical or theoretical contribution in stronger wording.<br>10. Emphasize the originality and novelty more explicitly in this section.                                                             |
| 📑 **Academic Flow**           | 1. Rewrite this passage into a standard academic structure: claim → evidence → explanation.<br>2. Restructure this paragraph to follow IMRaD flow (Introduction, Methods, Results, Discussion).<br>3. Rewrite to present the claim first, followed by supporting citations.<br>4. Organize this content to reflect the logic of problem → solution → implication.<br>5. Rewrite to ensure a smooth flow from background to objectives to contribution.<br>6. Edit this section to follow a deductive reasoning pattern (general → specific).<br>7. Rewrite to fit inductive reasoning (examples → pattern → conclusion).<br>8. Structure this section like a mini-essay: introduction → body → conclusion.<br>9. Rewrite so every claim is immediately supported by data or citation.<br>10. Organize sentences so each one logically supports the next in an academic manner.                         |
| ✂️ **Conciseness & Coherence** | 1. Simplify and reorganize this section so that every sentence directly supports the main idea.<br>2. Rewrite this passage to eliminate redundancy and repetition.<br>3. Condense this section while preserving key arguments.<br>4. Rewrite to remove filler words and unnecessary detail.<br>5. Improve conciseness by expressing ideas in fewer words without losing meaning.<br>6. Merge overlapping sentences to reduce wordiness.<br>7. Rewrite this so that only essential details remain.<br>8. Shorten this section while making the argument stronger and more focused.<br>9. Simplify long sentences into shorter, coherent ones.<br>10. Rewrite to increase coherence while cutting down word count.                                                                                                                                                                                       |


## 📝 **Step 3: Compare Before & After**

Paste your **original draft** and the **AI-enhanced version** side by side. Then reflect:

| **Aspect**           | **Original Draft** | **AI-Enhanced Draft** | **Improvement Observed** |
| -------------------- | ------------------ | --------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Flow 🔄              |                    |                       | Smoother transitions     |
| Argument Strength 🎯 |                    |                       | Clearer main point       |
| Contribution 🌟      |                    |                       | Highlighted contribution |
| Coherence 📑         |                    |                       | Better logical order     |
| Conciseness ✂️       |                    |                       | Less redundancy          |

## 💬 **Step 4: Reflection & Sharing**

* Share with a partner: **What was the biggest improvement in your section?**
* Discuss whether AI helped you **spot missing logic or highlight contributions** that you hadn’t noticed.

## 🎯 **Expected Outcome**

By the end of this exercise, participants will:

* Understand how to **organize paragraphs for maximum clarity and impact**.
* Be able to **strengthen arguments and highlight contributions** clearly.
* Produce a **coherent and logically flowing section** aligned with ERA/Scopus expectations.
