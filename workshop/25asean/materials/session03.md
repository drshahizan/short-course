# Session 3: Practical – Using Generative AI for Data Unification

## Introduction

The Department of Statistics Malaysia (DOSM) plays a crucial role in collecting, analyzing, and disseminating official statistics on various aspects of Malaysia's economy, population, society, and environment. In the fast-paced world of data management and analysis, integrating AI-powered tools can significantly enhance daily operations, improve efficiency, and support evidence-based decision-making. This guide focuses on six practical AI applications tailored for DOSM's workflow, such as data visualization, project planning, predictive analysis, presentation design, and document processing. These tools are designed for everyday use by statisticians, analysts, and administrators to streamline tasks like survey design, trend forecasting, report generation, and collaborative planning. By leveraging these resources, DOSM staff can visualize complex datasets, manage timelines for statistical releases, forecast economic indicators, create professional presentations for stakeholders, and extract insights from voluminous reports—ultimately fostering innovation and accuracy in national statistics. This compilation is based on open-source materials and can be adapted for secure, internal use while adhering to data privacy guidelines under the Statistics Act 1965.

## Exercise

1. **[Mind Maps with Markmap](latihan/markmap.md)**  
   Build interactive mind maps to visualize, organize, and structure statistical ideas effectively. In DOSM's daily work, this tool can help map out survey methodologies, categorize demographic data, or outline economic indicators for quick reference during team meetings or report planning.

2. **[Flowcharts, Concept Maps, & Mind Maps with Whimsical](latihan/whimsical.md)**  
   Use Whimsical integration in ChatGPT to design visual representations like flowcharts, concept maps, and mind maps for clearer communication of statistical processes. For DOSM tasks, it's ideal for illustrating data collection workflows, mapping population census concepts, or diagramming inter-departmental collaborations on national accounts.

3. **[Gantt Charts with ChatGPT](latihan/ganttchart.md)**  
   Generate project timelines and milestones in Gantt chart format for effective planning and management of statistical activities. This supports DOSM's routine operations, such as scheduling household surveys, tracking inflation data releases, or coordinating quarterly GDP reporting to ensure timely deliverables.

4. **1. [Poster to 🎬 Short Promo Video](latihan/poster.md)**

Learn how to transform a static event poster into a short vertical promotional video. This activity guides participants through crafting a visually appealing poster with event details and animating it using tools like **Grok › Imagine**. Ideal for promoting DOSM events, statistical awareness campaigns, or data-driven conferences on social media platforms.

5. **[Data Analysis with ChatGPT](latihan/chatgpt_chart.md)**
   Use ChatGPT’s Data Analysis feature to explore, visualize, and interpret statistical datasets interactively. Using the official population_malaysia.csv file from data.gov.my, participants will learn how to upload, clean, and analyze demographic data to uncover population trends across Malaysian states. This activity emphasizes practical applications such as computing summary statistics, generating charts that show year-by-year population growth, and identifying the fastest-growing states.

6. **[Forecasting with Deepseek](latihan/deepseek_prediction.md)**  
   Apply advanced AI-based forecasting to analyze data trends and generate predictive insights. In a DOSM context, it can be used daily for projecting economic growth rates, population trends, or labor market statistics, aiding in policy recommendations and long-term planning.
