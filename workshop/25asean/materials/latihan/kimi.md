#  Kimi Slides 

Kimi Slides is the AI-native slide generator inside the Kimi chatbot: you feed it a prompt, document, or URL, it instantly drafts a concise outline, then auto-builds a fully-designed, image-rich PowerPoint in under two minutes; you can swap themes, edit text or graphics inline, add speaker notes, and export as an editable .pptx or PNG set—turning raw ideas into presentation-ready decks with almost zero manual formatting. As of November 2025, Kimi Slides remains free for all users, with enhanced features available through Kimi+ (Moonshot AI's premium chatbot version, offering larger context, faster processing, and priority model access).

### 1. Accessing Kimi Slides
- Visit [https://www.kimi.com](https://www.kimi.com) and log in or sign up for a free account.
- In the left sidebar, under **Kimi+**, select **Kimi Slides**.
  *Note: If not visible, ensure you're using the latest Kimi version or activate the free Kimi+ trial for full access.*

### 2. Input Options for DOSM-Related Content
Tailor your input to statistical workflows:
- **Text Prompt**: Enter a description, e.g., "Create a 10-slide presentation on Malaysia's 2024 GDP growth trends, including key charts and economic indicators."
- **Upload Files**: Support for PDF, DOCX, or TXT files—ideal for DOSM reports, census data, or survey summaries.
- **Web Content**: Kimi automatically searches and extracts from relevant sites (displayed in a side panel) when using prompts; for specific sources, include URLs in your prompt.

### 3. Reviewing and Editing the Outline
- Kimi generates an editable outline in seconds, breaking down content into logical sections (e.g., introduction to data sources, key findings, visualizations, and recommendations).
- For DOSM work, add/delete/reorder sections using the **+** and trash icons to emphasize statistical highlights, such as trends in inflation rates or demographic shifts.
- Use the **Retry** button to refine if the outline misses critical data points—iterate for accuracy in daily reporting.

### 4. Selecting a Visual Theme
- Click **Generate Slides** to open the template gallery.
- Preview and choose a professional theme suited to DOSM presentations (e.g., clean, data-focused designs with neutral colors matching official branding).
  *Tip: Select themes that support charts and graphs for better visualization of statistics like employment rates or trade balances.*

### 5. Generating the Presentation
- The AI builds the deck in 30-120 seconds, including:
  - Title slides and section dividers.
  - Concise bullets per slide, focusing on one key statistical insight.
  - Royalty-free images, icons, or placeholders for charts (based on your data).
  - Uniform fonts, spacing, and color schemes.
- Monitor the progress bar; pause or cancel as needed for quick daily iterations.

### 6. Editing Within Kimi
Use the bottom toolbar for refinements tailored to DOSM tasks:
- **Change Template**: Switch styles without losing content—useful for adapting to different audiences, like internal vs. public reports.
- Edit text, images, or layouts inline (e.g., update figures from latest DOSM datasets).
- Add speaker notes via the note icon for presentation guidance on statistical interpretations.
- Duplicate, delete, or insert slides to expand on data analyses.

### 7. Exporting and Finalizing
- Download as **.pptx** (editable in PowerPoint) for further customization, such as adding DOSM logos, animations, or embedded charts.
- Alternatively, export as **PNG** images for quick sharing in emails or reports.
- Present directly from Kimi's web interface for informal daily meetings, or open in PowerPoint/Google Slides for advanced features like narration.

### 8. Best Practices for Daily and Work Use at DOSM
- **Save Prompts**: Store effective ones (e.g., "Summarize monthly CPI data with trends") as templates for recurring tasks like economic updates.
- **Regenerate with Updates**: Re-upload revised DOSM files (e.g., quarterly reports) to refresh slides in one click, retaining your theme.
- **Focus on Data Accuracy**: Always verify AI-simplified stats against original sources; manually add complex charts if not auto-extracted.
- **Time Efficiency**: Ideal for <5-minute workflows—transform raw statistical ideas into polished decks for meetings, workshops, or stakeholder briefings.

This streamlined process enables DOSM staff to handle daily statistical communications efficiently, from idea to ready presentation in under 5 minutes of active work. For the latest features, check Kimi updates regularly. Happy presenting
