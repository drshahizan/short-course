# Session 10: Hands-On Practice – Meeting Minutes & Summaries

Welcome to Session 10! We're diving into two of the most powerful ways AI can boost your daily productivity: creating structured meeting minutes and summarizing long documents. These skills will transform how you manage and share information.

## Generating Structured Meeting Minutes

Creating clear, accurate meeting minutes is a critical administrative task, but it can be a challenge to capture every detail while simultaneously following the discussion. AI can help you convert raw, chaotic notes or a meeting transcript into a professional, easy-to-read document that everyone can understand and act on.

### The Process: Step-by-Step

1.  **Capture Your Raw Notes:** The first step is to get the information. This can be your handwritten notes, bullet points you typed in a document, or a full transcription from a tool like Microsoft Teams or Otter.ai. Don't worry about perfection; the AI will do the heavy lifting.
2.  **Craft a Specific Prompt:** This is the most important part. Your prompt tells the AI exactly what you need. Think of it as a detailed instruction manual. A great prompt will include:
    * **The document's purpose:** "Generate meeting minutes."
    * **The desired sections:** "Include sections for Attendees, Key Discussion Points, Decisions Made, and Action Items."
    * **The format:** "Use bullet points for lists and bold headings for each section."
    * **Any additional details:** "The meeting was held on [Date] to discuss [Topic]."
3.  **Run the Prompt and Review:** Paste your raw notes and your detailed prompt into the AI. It will generate a first draft. Now, your job is to review it. Verify that all key decisions are correct, action items are assigned to the right people with the correct deadlines, and names are spelled properly. This human touch ensures accuracy.

### Example Prompt & Output

**Your Raw Input (Notes):**
> "Met today. Attendees were Sarah, John, and Mei. We talked about the marketing budget for Q4. John said we should focus more on social media ads. Sarah said to hold off on TV commercials for now. Mei agreed. We decided to allocate 70% of the budget to digital marketing. Sarah will draft the new budget proposal by next Friday. John will research new ad platforms. Mei will talk to the social media team about content."

**Your Prompt:**
> "From the following raw notes, generate structured meeting minutes with a professional tone. Create sections for 'Attendees,' 'Key Discussion Points,' 'Decisions Made,' and 'Action Items.' For Action Items, list the person responsible and the task."

**AI-Generated Output:**
> ### **Meeting Minutes**
> **Attendees:** Sarah, John, Mei
>
> **Key Discussion Points:**
> * The team reviewed the marketing budget for Q4.
> * John proposed increasing the focus on social media advertising.
> * Sarah suggested postponing the investment in TV commercials.
>
> **Decisions Made:**
> * It was decided to allocate 70% of the Q4 marketing budget to digital marketing.
>
> **Action Items:**
> * **Sarah:** Draft the new budget proposal. (Due: Next Friday)
> * **John:** Research new advertising platforms.
> * **Mei:** Coordinate with the social media team regarding content.


## Summarizing Long Documents into Key Points

In the professional world, you're often given lengthy reports, policies, or presentations to review. Trying to read every single page is inefficient. AI is an incredible tool for quickly distilling a document's core message.

### The Process: Step-by-Step

1.  **Copy and Paste the Content:** Simply copy the entire text from the document (or a significant portion) and paste it into the AI's chat box.
2.  **Give a Clear Instruction:** This is where you specify the type of summary you need. AI can do more than just a general summary; it can find specific information or rephrase it for a different audience.
3.  **Choose Your Format:** Tell the AI how you want the summary presented. This makes the information even more useful for you.

### Advanced Techniques & Prompts

* **For Executive Summaries:** "Summarize the following document into a concise executive summary. Highlight the primary findings, key challenges, and final recommendations."
* **For Action Items:** "Read the following meeting notes and extract only the action items. List the person responsible and the deadline in a table format."
* **For a Specific Audience:** "Simplify this technical report on network security into 3-4 bullet points that a non-technical support staff member can understand."
* **For Data Extraction:** "From the text below, find all instances of 'project start date' and list them. If a responsible person is mentioned, include their name."

**Example Before & After**

**Input (a paragraph from a policy document):**
> "The company's remote work policy, effective January 1, 2024, mandates that all employees who wish to work from home must submit a formal request to their direct supervisor at least two weeks prior to the intended start date. The supervisor will then evaluate the request based on team needs, project deadlines, and the employee's performance history. Approved requests will be reviewed quarterly. Employees are responsible for ensuring a secure and reliable internet connection and will be reimbursed up to RM150 per month for home office supplies upon submission of valid receipts."

**Prompt:**
> "Summarize this policy document into a list of key rules for employees who want to work from home."

**AI-Generated Output:**
> **Key Rules for Remote Work:**
> * You must submit a formal request to your supervisor at least two weeks beforehand.
> * The supervisor's approval depends on team needs, deadlines, and your performance.
> * Approved requests will be reviewed every three months.
> * You are responsible for a reliable internet connection.
> * You can be reimbursed up to RM150 per month for home office supplies by submitting receipts.

By using these techniques, you're not just saving time—you're transforming how you process information, allowing you to focus on strategic tasks rather than administrative ones.
