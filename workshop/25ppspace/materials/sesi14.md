# Session 14: Troubleshooting & Optimizing AI Prompts

Welcome to our final training session. So far, you've learned how to use AI for various tasks. Now, we'll focus on the most important skill: **prompt engineering**. This is the art of communicating effectively with AI to get better, more accurate, and more reliable results.

## Refining Prompts for Better Accuracy

A good prompt is the difference between a generic answer and a perfectly tailored one. By refining your prompts, you can transform the AI from a simple tool into a powerful, reliable assistant. Here are three key strategies to master:

### 1. Be Specific, Not Vague
The more detail you provide, the more precise the AI's response will be. Avoid broad questions that leave too much to the imagination.

* **Vague Prompt:** "Write about our new hiring process."
* **Refined Prompt:** "Draft a 500-word article for the staff newsletter explaining the new online hiring process. Include details on how to submit a job request, the automated shortlisting system, and the new interview scheduling platform."

### 2. Add Context and Constraints
Give the AI a role, set a clear purpose, and define boundaries. This helps the AI understand the tone and scope of its response.

* **Role-playing:** "You are a senior administrator drafting a response to a complaint."
* **Setting a Goal:** "The purpose of this email is to politely decline a request while offering an alternative solution."
* **Applying Constraints:** "The response should be no longer than three paragraphs and must not mention any specific budget figures."

### 3. Specify the Desired Output Format
Tell the AI exactly how you want the information presented. This ensures the output is immediately useful and saves you from reformatting.

* **Instead of just asking for a summary, specify:** "Summarize the key points in a bulleted list."
* **Instead of asking for data, request a table:** "Extract all dates, names, and project titles from the text and present them in a three-column table."
* **For a visual flow:** "Create a numbered list of steps for a simple process."


## Avoiding Common Mistakes

Even with good intentions, it's easy to fall into bad habits. By avoiding these common mistakes, you can significantly improve the quality of your AI interactions.

### 1. Giving Incomplete Instructions
AI is not a mind reader. If you ask it to complete a task but don't provide all the necessary information, it will either refuse the request or provide a useless, generic answer.

* **Mistake:** "Write a report on our recent event."
* **Correction:** You must provide the raw data, notes, or specific facts you want included in the report.

### 2. Using Ambiguous Language
Words can have multiple meanings. Be as clear as possible to avoid misinterpretation.

* **Mistake:** "Organize the documents." (Does this mean sorting them alphabetically, by date, or into a specific folder structure?)
* **Correction:** "Create a digital folder structure for the documents, organized by year and then by department."

### 3. Expecting Human-like Intuition
AI lacks intuition and common sense. It only understands what you tell it, not what you *meant* to tell it. It cannot infer your intent.

* **Mistake:** "Help me with the student registration." (The AI doesn't know what kind of help you need, what "student registration" entails at UTMSpace, or what specific platform you are using.)
* **Correction:** "Explain the step-by-step process for a student to register for a new course in the UTMSpace student portal."

### 4. Not Iterating
The first response from an AI is not always the final answer. Treat the first output as a draft and be ready to refine your prompt based on what you get.

* **Initial Prompt:** "Summarize this report."
* **Refinement 1:** "That's too long. Summarize it in no more than 150 words."
* **Refinement 2:** "Make the summary shorter and focus on the financial implications mentioned in the report."

Mastering these techniques will empower you to use AI with confidence and precision. The better you are at prompting, the more valuable this technology will become in your daily work.
