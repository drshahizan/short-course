||Respected Prof. Dr. Mohd Shahizan, I hope this message finds you well. My name is Ancy Sara Cheriyan. I am currently working as an IT lecturer in the School of ICT at Bahrain Polytechnic, Kingdom of Bahrain delivering courses related to Database Systems and Data Mining. I wish to pursue my PhD related to Data analytics and hence have applied at Universiti Teknologi Malaysia under Faculty of Computing. I am writing to respectfully request your guidance as my research supervisor for my upcoming research titled "An Empirical Study on the Impact of Decision-Making Models and Data Analytics on Student Academic Performance, Success, and Retention". I believe your mentorship and guidance would be invaluable in helping me achieve my research goals.  One of my colleagues, Mr. Alex James, who is your current PhD scholar, has encouraged me to reach out to you, highlighting your guidance and support as highly beneficial to his own research work. In my previous role, I have extensive experience as a programme manager, where I closely analyze student performance and success metrics. This experience has allowed me to understand patterns in student outcomes and apply contemporary decision-making models to improve learning interventions which directly aligns with the focus of my proposed research.  I am also deeply interested in research and have gained valuable experience working on a recent university-funded project, which further strengthened my skills in conducting systematic investigations and handling data-driven studies. I am open to making necessary changes, refining my approach, and learning new ideas under your supervision so that the research is both challenging and impactful.|
