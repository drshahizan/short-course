# Session 7: AI for Organising Administrative Tasks

This session focuses on the practical application of AI as a personal or team-based administrative assistant. The goal is to demonstrate how AI can be used to automate and streamline a wide range of organizational tasks, from event planning to daily schedule management and project tracking.

## Coordinating Office Events or Activities

Planning and organizing events, whether they are small team-building activities or large company-wide functions, can be complex. AI can help by handling the initial planning, communication, and logistical coordination.

* **Generating a Planning Checklist:** A user can provide the type of event and the AI will generate a comprehensive checklist of all necessary steps. For example, a prompt could be: "Create a detailed checklist for planning a company holiday party for 50 people. Include tasks like 'venue selection,' 'catering,' 'invitations,' and 'entertainment.'"
* **Drafting Communication:** AI can be used to draft all the necessary communication materials. For instance, a user can ask the AI to: "Draft a fun and engaging email invitation for a team happy hour. Include the date, time, and location, and a call to action to RSVP." The AI can also draft follow-up reminders and thank-you notes.
* **Creating a Simple Budget:** A user can prompt the AI with the event's budget and it can help allocate funds to different categories. For example, "Given a budget of $5,000 for a team offsite, propose a breakdown of costs for transportation, accommodation, meals, and activities."
* **Generating a Schedule/Agenda:** For an event with multiple sessions, the AI can create a detailed agenda. A prompt could be: "Create a minute-by-minute schedule for a half-day workshop on design thinking. Include time for breaks and a summary of each session."

## Planning and Organizing Daily Work Schedules

Managing a busy professional schedule is critical for productivity. AI can assist in optimizing daily routines, managing appointments, and ensuring a balanced and efficient workflow.

* **Creating a Daily Itinerary:** Based on a user's to-do list, the AI can create a suggested daily schedule. A prompt could be: "Create a daily schedule for me tomorrow. My tasks are: 'finish the quarterly report,' 'have a 30-minute call with Sarah,' 'prepare for the client meeting,' and 'respond to all outstanding emails.' Please allocate time for a 15-minute coffee break."
* **Time Blocking:** AI can help implement time-blocking strategies by automatically allocating specific time slots for different types of tasks. For example, a user could ask the AI to "block off the first hour of every day for 'deep work' on my most important project, and the last 30 minutes for 'email and admin tasks.'"
* **Prioritization:** A user can provide a list of tasks, and the AI can help prioritize them based on urgency and importance. The prompt could be: "Prioritize the following tasks for me: 'draft a proposal,' 'review an expense report,' 'book a flight,' and 'update a spreadsheet.' Consider that the proposal is the most urgent."
* **Integration with Calendar Tools:** While not a direct function of a general AI, some platforms and integrations allow AI to create calendar events, set reminders, and manage RSVPs directly from a conversational prompt.

## Tracking and Following up on Tasks

Effective follow-up is essential for project management and professional accountability. AI can act as a diligent assistant, helping to keep track of tasks and ensure nothing falls through the cracks.

* **Generating a Task List:** The AI can take notes from a meeting or an email and generate a clear, actionable list of tasks. For example, "From the following meeting notes, create a list of all action items, assign them to the correct person, and suggest a deadline for each."
* **Drafting Follow-up Reminders:** A user can ask the AI to write professional and polite follow-up emails for outstanding tasks. A prompt could be: "Draft a polite follow-up email to a client about an invoice that is 15 days overdue." The AI can even be instructed to vary the tone of the reminder based on how long a task has been pending.
* **Creating a Project Status Report:** The AI can take a series of updates from a team and synthesize them into a concise project status report. For instance, "Based on these team updates from the past week, create a project status report for our senior manager. Highlight progress on key milestones and any potential roadblocks."
* **Managing Dependencies:** For complex projects, a user can ask the AI to "identify any task dependencies in this project plan and suggest a new order of operations to ensure no delays."

By the end of this session, participants will be able to use AI to effectively manage a wide range of administrative and organizational tasks, freeing up their time and mental energy for more strategic work.
