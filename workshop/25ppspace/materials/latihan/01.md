# Prompt Frameworks

In this exercise, you will learn how to apply **prompting frameworks** when working with Generative AI tools. The goal is to help staff write clear, structured, and purposeful prompts that produce useful results for real administrative tasks at UTMSpace.

Two frameworks will be used:

1. **PROMPT Framework** ‚Äì A detailed method for designing structured prompts for complex tasks. Staff will practice breaking down a task into clear instructions, ensuring that the AI produces accurate, complete, and professional outputs.
2. **R.A.C.E. Framework** ‚Äì A simpler, easy-to-remember structure for everyday tasks. Staff will practice creating short, focused prompts that still provide enough context for effective responses.

By completing this exercise, staff will:

* Understand the **difference** between detailed and simplified prompting approaches.
* Practice **real UTMSpace tasks** such as drafting emails, writing memos, preparing checklists, and summarizing reports.
* Compare outputs generated from both frameworks to decide which is more effective for different tasks.
