# Session 3: AI for Information Search & Retrieval

## üìù Exercise Introduction

This exercise helps UTMSpace Support Staff practice how to use Generative AI for **information search and retrieval** tasks. Staff will learn how to:

* Use prompts to **find specific facts** for administrative work.
* Generate **Q\&A content** for staff and participants.
* Summarize long documents or online resources into concise points.
* Organize complex information into **mind maps** for clarity.

By completing this exercise, staff will gain practical skills in transforming scattered information into clear, structured outputs that support daily operations at UTMSpace.
