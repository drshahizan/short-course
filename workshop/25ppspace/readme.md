 <img src="https://github.com/drshahizan/short-course/blob/main/workshop/25ppspace/images/pputmspace.jpeg" alt="Shahizan SLR"  height="400">

## Synopsis

The **two-day training program** on Artificial Intelligence (AI) for space support staff is designed to build practical knowledge and skills in applying AI tools for administrative and operational tasks. The training emphasizes **hands-on learning**, ensuring participants can immediately integrate AI into their daily workflows.

### Day 1: Foundations and Applications

The first day introduces participants to the **fundamentals of AI and Generative AI tools**, including effective prompting strategies. Through sessions on **information search, summarization, and document assistance**, staff learn to harness AI for drafting letters, emails, reports, and translations. Practical modules cover **presentation and visual design** (slides, posters, graphics) as well as **task organization and scheduling**. The day concludes with a critical discussion on **ethics, bias, privacy, and responsible AI use**.

### Day 2: Hands-On Practice and Optimization

The second day focuses on **applied practice**, allowing participants to draft professional communications, generate meeting minutes, and create presentations/posters with AI. Sessions also introduce **data handling techniques**, such as automating data entry and extracting survey insights. Further modules guide participants in **task coordination**, **refining AI prompts**, and leveraging **AI shortcuts and integrations with Microsoft Office tools**. The training concludes with best practices for efficient daily AI use.

### Outcome

By the end of the program, participants will:

* Understand AI concepts and tools relevant to administrative and support roles.
* Apply AI to improve efficiency in writing, documentation, presentations, and scheduling.
* Use AI responsibly, with awareness of ethical and privacy considerations.
* Gain confidence in troubleshooting and optimizing prompts for accurate results.

## [Course Schedule](materials/tentatif.md)

This section presents the **complete course schedule**, including the sequence of sessions, activities, and breaks. It helps participants understand the expected flow of the program, the timing of hands-on exercises, and the balance between **theoretical explanations** and **practical training**. The schedule ensures a **structured learning pathway**, beginning with an introduction to the fundamentals of AI, followed by its applications in education, AI-driven instructional design, and concluding with discussions on ethics, privacy, security, workshop activities, as well as evaluation and reflection sessions.

## [Teaching Materials](materials/teaching.md)

This section provides the **core reference materials** used throughout the course. It includes official guidelines on the use of AI in higher education, international reports on AI adoption, lecture notes, presentation slides, and step-by-step guides. Collectively, these resources offer participants a solid foundation of **theoretical knowledge, best practices, and practical guidance** to strengthen learning during the course and to support the **sustained use of AI in teaching and learning**.

## [AI Tools](materials/ai.md)

This section introduces participants to a **set of carefully selected AI tools designed to support teaching and learning processes**. The descriptions equip educators with the **digital skills** needed to integrate AI into their practice in an **ethical, effective, and innovative** manner.

## [Practical Exercises](materials/latihan.md)

The **practical exercises** are designed to ensure participants can **translate theoretical knowledge into real-world applications**. These exercises are **individual-based and hands-on**, allowing each participant to **master the fundamentals of AI use** through progressive tasks while **exploring AI applications** within their own teaching and learning contexts. Through these activities, participants will have opportunities to develop **instructional materials**, **assessment instruments**, and **AI usage policies** that can be directly applied in the classroom. In addition, the exercises encourage participants to build **professional reflections** that serve as a guide for **continuous improvement**. Overall, the exercises act as a **bridge between theory and practice**, enabling participants to gain **practical skills, ethical awareness, and confidence** in using AI effectively within **higher education**.
