2. Sample Output:

```
This dataset provides information about the population in Malaysia. Here are the data fields included:

1. **date**: The date the data was recorded, in YYYY-MM-DD format.
2. **sex**: Gender category, listed as 'both', 'male', or 'female'.
3. **age**: Age group of the population, including 'overall' and specific ranges such as '0-4', '5-9', etc.
4. **ethnicity**: Ethnic classification, such as 'overall', and potentially other ethnic groups in additional rows.
5. **population**: Population count, expressed in thousands (e.g., 10881.8 means 10,881,800 people).

Example data:

- On January 1, 1970, the total population of Malaysia was 10,881,800.
- The population of the 0‚Äì4 age group on that date was 1,702,400.
- The population for the 5‚Äì9 age group was 1,690,300.

This dataset can be used to analyze population trends by year, gender, age group, and ethnicity.
