# 2. Idea Generation & Research Design

## üî∏ Purpose
To develop and expand research questions, hypotheses, and theoretical foundations. This is the stage of creativity and clarity.

## üí° Why Use AI in This Step?
AI stimulates creativity, expands narrow ideas into broader frameworks, and suggests logical progressions. It also helps structure research designs and provides inspiration from global knowledge bases.

## AI Tools

**üßÆ [Qwen](./ai/qwen.md)** is a large language model optimized for logical reasoning and academic exploration, particularly useful in formulating structured research arguments and logical frameworks. It helps researchers, especially bilingual (Chinese-English) users, to generate coherent research questions, develop research proposals, and refine conceptual ideas by simulating logical academic discourse.

**üîç [Kimi](./ai/kimi.md)** is an advanced AI assistant that allows researchers to upload scientific papers and interact with the content through natural language queries. Ideal for research design, Kimi enables users to extract insights, understand technical jargon, and identify knowledge gaps or potential variables, making it easier to build upon existing literature and shape focused research questions.

**üîç [Grok](./ai/grok.md)** is a conversational AI designed to simulate creative reasoning and exploratory thought processes. It supports early-stage research design by offering unconventional perspectives, brainstorming alternative angles, and challenging assumptions, effectively acting as an idea sparring partner for researchers trying to frame or rethink their studies.

**üñºÔ∏è [Napkin AI](./ai/napkin.md)** takes raw or loosely structured research ideas and turns them into visual concept diagrams, helping researchers articulate their study‚Äôs structure. Whether outlining hypotheses, mapping logical flows, or designing theoretical frameworks, Napkin AI provides quick visualizations that assist in planning and refining research models or flowcharts.

**üó∫Ô∏è [Ideamap.ai](./ai/ideamap.md)** is a visual ideation tool that transforms initial keywords or phrases into an expandable map of interconnected concepts. It is particularly effective for researchers in the idea generation stage, allowing them to explore related topics, identify research gaps, and develop structured themes or research directions from vague starting points.
