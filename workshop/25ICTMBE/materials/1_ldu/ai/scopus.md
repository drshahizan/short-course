# 🔍 [Scopus AI](https://www-scopus-com.ezproxy.utm.my/pages/home#scopus-ai): Enhancing Research with Generative AI

 <img src="https://i0.wp.com/mainlib.upd.edu.ph/wp-content/uploads/scopus-ai.png" alt="Dr Shahizan AI tools"  height="400">

**Scopus AI** is a generative AI-powered research assistant developed by **Elsevier**, integrated within the **Scopus platform**. It is designed to support researchers with intuitive, efficient exploration of peer-reviewed scientific literature using advanced natural language processing and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technology.

## 💡 Role of Scopus AI in Research Design & Idea Generation

### 1. **Natural Language Topic Exploration**
- Unlike traditional keyword searches, Scopus AI allows you to ask questions in plain language.
- It returns **Topic Summaries** and **Expanded Summaries** that synthesize findings from peer-reviewed articles.
- Example:  
  > “What are the current challenges in adopting AI for university teaching?”

### 2. **Identifying Research Gaps and Trends**
- Scopus AI analyzes existing publications and highlights:
  - Underexplored areas
  - Emerging themes
  - Overlapping or outdated studies
- This helps identify **where your research can contribute meaningfully**.

### 3. **Framework & Model Discovery**
- Search queries like "What frameworks are used to study digital transformation in higher education?" return a list of models, including references and confidence scores.
- These references assist in building your **conceptual framework or theoretical base**.

### 4. **Generating Research Questions and Hypotheses**
- Based on retrieved summaries and key papers, Scopus AI can help:
  - Draft potential research questions
  - Identify independent/dependent variables
  - Propose hypothesis directions
- Example:  
  > “Suggest three possible research questions for a study on blockchain in agriculture.”

### 5. **Designing a Suitable Research Methodology**
- Scopus AI identifies common methods used in specific research domains:
  - Quantitative vs qualitative
  - Survey vs experimental designs
  - Data collection tools
- You can explore methodological trends over time and across disciplines.

## ⚙️ Why Use Scopus AI in This Step?

| Step                             | Benefits of Using Scopus AI                                          |
|----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Topic Exploration                | Finds and summarizes emerging research themes                        |
| Literature Gap Identification    | Highlights areas with little or outdated coverage                    |
| Theoretical Support              | Recommends models and frameworks based on literature                 |
| Research Questions Drafting      | Helps transform ideas into structured, testable questions            |
| Methodological Planning          | Identifies commonly used research methods in a given field           |


## 🚀 Strengths for Researchers

- **Credible Sources Only**: All results are drawn from Scopus’s indexed, peer-reviewed literature.
- **Cited Summaries**: Topic and expanded summaries include references and confidence indicators.
- **Interactive Concept Maps**: Visually explore how ideas and subfields are connected.
- **Expert Discovery**: Identifies key researchers working on similar themes.


## 📌 Limitations to Consider

- **Subscription-Based**: Full access to Scopus AI requires an institutional subscription.
- **Citation Generation Only Within Scopus**: No automatic APA/MLA export outside the platform.
- **Limited Creative Input**: Unlike open LLMs, Scopus AI is academically conservative and fact-bound.


## ✅ Example Prompt Ideas

```text
1. "What are the main research gaps in AI governance in the public sector?"
2. "What theoretical models are used to study faculty readiness for digital tools?"
3. "Suggest research questions based on the current literature on smart cities."
4. "What methods are commonly used in research on personalized learning systems?"
5. "Summarize recent findings on cybersecurity challenges in higher education."
```
