## Abstract Writing Template (PIMPAC): A Clear Structure for Your Research

 <img src="https://github.com/drshahizan/short-course/blob/main/25upsi/images/abstract.jpeg" alt="Image Alt Text"  height="600">

Master the **PIMPAC framework** to craft concise, structured, and impactful abstracts that effectively communicate your research. Each component is designed to address key aspects of your study and its significance.

### **‚Üí P - Problem Statement**
**Define the problem your research addresses** by describing the broader context and its importance.  
- **What to Include**:
  - Clearly outline the issue your study tackles.
  - Explain its relevance in terms of public health, policy, or other applicable fields.
- **Example**:  
  *Mosquito-borne diseases continue to affect millions annually, with urbanization and climate change exacerbating the problem in densely populated regions.*

### **‚Üí I - Investigative Focus**
**Highlight the specific research question or gap** your study addresses, along with your objective.  
- **What to Include**:
  - Emphasize the research gap or challenge.
  - Clearly state the research question or study's focus.
- **Example**:  
  *This study examines the influence of poor urban infrastructure on mosquito breeding sites and dengue transmission, focusing on under-researched informal settlements in tropical regions.*


### **‚Üí M - Methods Employed**
**Describe how the research was conducted**, including your design, methodology, and data collection.  
- **What to Include**:
  - Summarize your research approach.
  - Mention the type of data and analysis performed.
- **Example**:  
  *We employed a multi-stage research design, using satellite imagery for spatial mapping of breeding sites, combined with epidemiological surveillance data to assess dengue incidence in three urban slums.*


### **‚Üí P - Principal Findings**
**Present the key results** that directly answer your research question or hypothesis.  
- **What to Include**:
  - Highlight the most significant findings or outcomes.
  - Focus on results relevant to your research goals.
- **Example**:  
  *Our findings revealed a 40% increase in mosquito breeding activity in areas with unpaved roads and stagnant water, leading to a 30% spike in dengue cases during the rainy season.*


### **‚Üí A - Application & Impact**
**Explain the broader implications** of your findings and their potential impact.  
- **What to Include**:
  - Discuss how your results contribute to the field or solve practical problems.
  - Link your findings to policy, public health, or other areas of influence.
- **Example**:  
  *These findings underscore the need for targeted interventions, such as improved drainage systems and environmental management, in urban planning to mitigate mosquito-borne diseases.*


### **‚Üí C - Conclusion & Call-to-Action**
**Summarize your research contributions** and propose actionable steps for the future.  
- **What to Include**:
  - Restate the significance of your research.
  - Suggest future research directions or policy recommendations.
- **Example**:  
  *Our study highlights the critical need for interdisciplinary approaches to vector control, combining urban infrastructure improvements with community-based mosquito surveillance. Future studies should focus on scaling these interventions across other vulnerable regions.*


‚úÖ **Use this template** to ensure your abstract is well-structured, impactful, and effectively communicates the essence of your research.
