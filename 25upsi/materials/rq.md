### **‚ùì Why is a Research Question Important?**
Your research question is the **central inquiry** that drives your dissertation. It:
- Defines the focus and scope of your research.
- Shapes the methodology and data collection approach.
- Guides the analysis and interpretation of results.
- Aligns the study with academic and practical goals.

### **Steps to Develop Strong Research Questions**

#### **Step 1Ô∏è‚É£: Brainstorming and Reflection**
Begin by reflecting on your interests and goals. Ask yourself:
- What topics genuinely excite me?
- What problems or issues am I passionate about solving?
- What are my research goals and objectives?
- Which key concepts and theories relate to my topic?

üí° **Tip**: Write down your ideas, even vague ones. This process generates a pool of potential research directions.

---

#### **Step 2Ô∏è‚É£: Conducting Preliminary Research**
Deepen your understanding of your topic by:
- Exploring relevant literature.
- Attending academic seminars or webinars.
- Engaging with experts in the field.

This helps you:
‚úîÔ∏è Identify gaps in existing research.  
‚úîÔ∏è Understand the current state of knowledge.  
‚úîÔ∏è Highlight unexplored or underexplored areas.

üí° **Tip**: Take detailed notes on key findings, debates, and controversies to refine your focus.

- Which variables or factors are key to your research?
- What potential outcomes or implications can arise from your study?

**Techniques to Refine Your Research Question**:
- **Mind Mapping**: Visualize your ideas and connect related concepts.
- **SWOT Analysis**: Analyze the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats of your chosen topic.
- **Concept Mapping**: Diagram relationships between theories, concepts, and ideas.
